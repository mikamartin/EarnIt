# EarnIt — Cleanup Log

A record of every structured cleanup pass run on this codebase since development began.

Each pass follows the checklist in [DEV_PLAYBOOK.md §1 Post-Work Cleanup](DEV_PLAYBOOK.md) and covers: duplication, decoupling, complexity, dead code, naming consistency, hardcoded values, accessibility, deprecated APIs, spec alignment, and test coverage. Passes are triggered after any significant feature work or refactor.

For a portfolio reader: this log exists to show that code quality is treated as an ongoing discipline. The checklist runs after every meaningful change — not because every pass finds something critical, but because the habit of looking is what prevents the slow accumulation of tech debt that makes codebases hard to work in.

> **How to add a new entry:** Copy the checklist from `DEV_PLAYBOOK.md §1`, paste a new `### Pass N — description` section at the bottom of this file, and tick off what you found and fixed. Passes 1–23 reference branch names instead of descriptions — that was the original convention, since superseded.

---

### Pass 1 — `deep-clean` branch

#### Schema & Data Naming ✅
- Renamed DB table `hall_of_fame_entries` → `history_entries` (DB version 8 → 9, `fallbackToDestructiveMigration`)
- Removed `@ColumnInfo(name = "hallOfFameEntryId")` workaround — column now matches property name `historyEntryId`
- Updated all SQL queries in `Daos.kt`
- Renamed JSON export field `hallOfFameEntries` → `historyEntries`

#### Dead Code ✅
- Deleted `Color.kt` (exact duplicate of warm-gold colors in `ColorSchemes.kt`)
- Removed dead `LightColors` / `DarkColors` from `EarnItTheme.kt` (defined but never used)
- Removed unused `TaskWithLogs` POJO from `Entities.kt`
- Removed unused `NOTES_REQUIRED_DESCRIPTION` from `Strings.kt`
- Deleted `pugsly_blue.png` and `pugsly_forest.png` (unreferenced drawables)
- Renamed `HallOfFameAttributionTest.kt` → `LogAttributionTest.kt` to match class name

#### Hardcoded Colors ✅
- `checkmarkColor = Color(0xFF3D2900)` → `MaterialTheme.colorScheme.onPrimary` (3 occurrences)
- Quote text `Color(0xFF3D2900)` → `MaterialTheme.colorScheme.onSurface`
- Card backgrounds `Color(0xFFF5ECD8)` → `MaterialTheme.colorScheme.surfaceVariant` (all occurrences)

#### Form State ✅
- `TaskEditScreen` form fields changed from `remember` → `rememberSaveable` (survives screen rotation)

#### Deprecated APIs ✅
- `Icons.Default.ArrowBack` → `Icons.AutoMirrored.Filled.ArrowBack` (5 occurrences)
- `Icons.Outlined.LibraryBooks` → `Icons.AutoMirrored.Outlined.LibraryBooks` (2 occurrences)
- `Icons.Filled.Assignment` → `Icons.AutoMirrored.Filled.Assignment` (1 occurrence)

#### Code Quality ✅
- Unused variables removed: `activeTab` (EarnItApp), `trackColor` (HomeScreen, RewardDetailScreen)
- Unused parameter removed: `uiState` on `SettingsScreen`

#### Design System ✅
- Extracted `ClaimPillButton` and `LogPillButton` into `EarnItButtons.kt` — card action buttons now use a single source of truth
- Extracted `InfoIconButton` into `EarnItButtons.kt` — consistent ⓘ icon across all settings sections

---

### Pass 2 — `deep-clean` branch (spec sync + hygiene)

#### Spec Accuracy ✅
- `EARNIT_SPEC.md` Storage row: schema `v8` → `v9` (DB was migrated in Pass 1, spec not updated)
- Section 4 History: `HallOfFameEntryEntity` → `HistoryEntryEntity`; `hallOfFameEntryId` → `historyEntryId` (entity was renamed in Pass 1)
- Section 7 Export/Import: JSON format field `hallOfFameEntries` → `historyEntries` (field was renamed in Pass 1)
- Section 6 Settings: added four previously undocumented settings — `Nickname`, `Use Random Nickname`, `Show Pugsly`, `Show Quote`
- Section 10 Screen Map: added `Appearance` settings section (was in code but missing from spec)

#### Dead Code ✅
- Removed unused imports `BlendMode` and `ColorFilter` from `EarnItApp.kt`

#### Template Additions ✅
- Added "test/debug helpers marked for removal" check to Dead Code section
- Added "inline user-visible strings not in Strings.kt" check to Dead Code section
- Added new **Accessibility** section (contentDescription on icon buttons, 48 dp touch targets)

---

### Pass 3 — hardcoded colours sweep

#### Dark Mode Quote Card ✅
- `QuoteOfTheDay` card background and label background: `Color.White` → `MaterialTheme.colorScheme.surface` (card was white-on-dark in dark mode)
- Border gradient: hardcoded `Color(0xFFE8A000)` / `Color(0xFF2A9D8F)` → `accents.gradientStart` / `accents.gradientEnd` (now follows Ocean Blue and Forest themes)
- Label text color: hardcoded `Color(0xFFE8A000)` → `accents.gradientStart`

#### Warm-Gold Gradient Brushes ✅
Replaced all remaining `Brush.*Gradient(listOf(Color(0xFFFFD060), Color(0xFFE07B00)))` (and the `Color(0xFFE8A000)` / `Color(0xFFE07B00)` border variant) with `accents.gradientStart` / `accents.gradientEnd` in:
- `ClaimPillButton` (`EarnItButtons.kt`)
- `LogPillButton` — also fixed `compositeOver(Color.White)` → `compositeOver(MaterialTheme.colorScheme.surface)`
- `HomeScreen` — Add Reward FAB
- `RewardDetailScreen` — `accentColor` local val, CLAIM button, LOG button background and border
- `RewardEditScreen` — Save button
- `TasksScreen` — Add Task FAB (consolidated double `LocalEarnItAccents.current` read)
- `TaskDetailScreen` — LOG button background and border (aligned with `RewardDetailScreen` pattern)
- `TaskEditScreen` — Save button
- `ClaimDialog` — "Archive & Start Over" button

---

### Pass 4 — `celebratory-feedback` branch

#### Celebratory Feedback — Phase A ✅
- Animated progress bar fill: `animateFloatAsState(500ms, FastOutSlowInEasing)` applied to both `RewardProgressCard` and `RewardDetailScreen`
- Floating `+X` label on task log: `Animatable` offset + alpha, `LaunchedEffect(rp.totalPoints)`, triggered on point increase only — both home screen cards and reward detail
- Animated gradient border at 100%: `infiniteRepeatable` alpha pulse (900ms) via `BorderStroke` on `RewardProgressCard` and `Modifier.border` on `RewardDetailScreen` card container
- CLAIM button scale pulse: `infiniteRepeatable` scale 1.0→1.05 (700ms) on `ClaimPillButton` (card) and CLAIM Box (detail)
- Haptics: `hapticTap()` View extension wired to LOG tap, CLAIM tap, Save Reward, Save Quest — no in-app toggle needed (respects device system setting)
- `detailAccents` duplicate `LocalEarnItAccents.current` read in `RewardDetailScreen` removed (was redundant after earlier gradient sweep)

#### UX Fix ✅
- `LogTaskDialog` task rows: entire row is now tappable (`.clickable` on the `Row`), not just the `RadioButton`

---

### Pass 5 — `tasks-rename-groups` branch

#### Dead Code ✅
- Removed stray `// Group field` inline comment from `TaskEditScreen` (added during implementation, no longer needed).

#### Test Data ✅
- `TestDataSeeder`: added `group` assignments to all tasks (Fitness, Mindfulness, Home, Skills) with one task (`Cold Shower`) left ungrouped to showcase the "Other" section in group view.

#### Unit Tests ✅
- `RepositoryBehaviourTest`: two `importTemplate` tests now assert `group = template.name` on inserted tasks — this was shipped logic without test coverage.

#### Spec ✅
- All 8 phases of Task Groups & Quest Rebrand marked complete in `EARNIT_SPEC.md`.
- Added "Max Tasks Per Reward — Cap & Warning" to Deferred Ideas with full rationale.

#### Deferred from this pass
- `Color(0xFF2A9D8F)` repeatable icon tint in `LogTaskDialog` — pre-existing hardcoded color, not introduced by this branch.
- 32dp `IconButton` touch targets for mandatory/repeatable flag toggles inside `AddTaskToRewardDialog`'s task rows — below the 48dp accessibility minimum; acceptable trade-off in a constrained list dialog. Revisit when `EarnItApp.kt` is split.
- Collapsed-section composable pattern duplicated between `TasksScreen` and `AddTaskToRewardDialog` — extraction deferred to the `EarnItApp.kt` split (pre-release checklist).

---

### Pass 6 — IO fix, clean-up feedback, group picker, duplicate protection, import dedup

#### Bug Fixes ✅
- **IO thread crash (`clearAll`, `importFromJson`):** `database.clearAllTables()` is a blocking non-suspend call that was executing on `Dispatchers.Main`, causing an `IllegalStateException` crash that left all data intact. Both `clearAll()` and the replace branch of `importFromJson()` are now wrapped in `withContext(Dispatchers.IO)`.
- **Clear Logs leaving History entries:** `clearAllLogs()` only deleted `completion_logs` rows; `history_entries` were untouched, so History showed claimed rewards after a log clear. Added `deleteAllEntries()` to `HistoryDao` and called it from `clearAllLogs()`.
- **`nameConflict` scope error:** Variable was computed inside the bottom-buttons Row in `TaskEditScreen` but referenced in the name field (`isError`) and error text above that Row — outside its declaration scope. Moved to the top of the composable function.

#### UX Improvements ✅
- **CleanUpScreen snackbar feedback:** All four operations (Clear Logs, Clear Tasks, Clear Rewards, Clear All) now show a `SnackbarHost` confirmation message after the operation completes. `CleanUpScreen` gained a `Scaffold` wrapper for this.
- **Group picker redesign (`TaskEditScreen`):** Replaced the autocomplete `OutlinedTextField` with a bordered radio-button list showing all existing groups plus a "New group" option. Selecting "New group" reveals an `OutlinedTextField` for the new name. Clearing the custom name de-selects "New group". When no groups exist yet, only the text field is shown.
- **Duplicate name blocking:** `TaskEditScreen` and `RewardEditScreen` both compute `nameConflict` at the composable root. While a conflict exists: the name field shows `isError = true`, an inline error message appears below it, and the Save button is disabled via `canSave = name.isNotBlank() && !nameConflict`.
- **Import deduplication with dialog:** `importTemplate()` now checks existing task names (lowercase-trimmed `HashSet`) before inserting and returns a list of skipped names. `TaskLibraryScreen` shows an `AlertDialog` listing skipped names after import rather than silently discarding them.

#### Test Data ✅
- `TestDataSeeder`: added long-name task (`"Early Morning 5km Run Before Breakfast"`), high-points task (`"Complete a 10km Race"`, 25 pts), long-name reward (`"Weekend Hiking Trip to the Mountains"`), high-cost reward (`"International Flight"`, 500 pts), and multi-sentence detail strings on several log entries to exercise overflow/truncation in list views.

#### Unit Tests ✅
- `RepositoryBehaviourTest`: added `coEvery { taskDao.getAllTasks() } returns emptyList()` to all three `importTemplate` tests — the updated function now calls `getAllTasks()` to build the dedup set and the mock was missing.

#### Deferred from this pass
- Snackbar strings in `CleanUpScreen` ("Logs cleared", "Tasks cleared", "Rewards cleared", "Everything wiped") are inline in the composable — should move to `Strings.kt` before release.
- `CleanupTest` unit test does not yet assert that `clearAllLogs()` also calls `historyDao.deleteAllEntries()` — the behavior is correct in code but the test description only says "deletes all logs." Extend before release.

---

### Pass 7 — `review-button-colors` branch

#### Button Color System ✅
- All primary action buttons (both FABs, both Save buttons, full-width CLAIM, LOG dialog buttons, "Archive & Start Over") migrated from hardcoded accent gradient fills to `MaterialTheme.colorScheme.primary` — now theme-aware and correctly contrasted in all three schemes and light/dark variants.
- Button labels and icons: hardcoded `Color.White` restored on FAB icons and all button text — consistent across themes.
- `ClaimPillButton` (`EarnItButtons.kt`): same gradient→primary migration; removed now-unused `LocalEarnItAccents` import.

#### Design System ✅
- Extracted `RadioRow` composable into `EarnItButtons.kt` — full-row tappable radio option with `onClick = null` on the inner `RadioButton` (correct M3 pattern). Applied in `LogForRewardDialog`; existing `RadioButton` instances in reward-detail LOG dialog and group picker cleaned up to use `onClick = null` (rows were already clickable).
- `RadioButton` selected color set to `colorScheme.primary` wherever `RadioButtonDefaults.colors` is specified.

#### Hardcoded Colors ✅
- Claim dialog: title, "Archive Only" border + text, and Cancel text were hardcoded `Color(0xFFE8A000)` — replaced with `MaterialTheme.colorScheme.primary`.

#### Dead Code ✅
- Removed four unused `val accents = LocalEarnItAccents.current` declarations in `HomeScreen`, `RewardEditScreen`, `TaskEditScreen`, and `ClaimDialog` — their only use (button gradient fills) was removed by the button migration.

#### UX Fix ✅
- Note/detail pen icon in all log entry rows (`CompletedTasksTab`, `ClaimedRewardsTab`, `RewardDetailScreen`, `TaskDetailScreen`): changed `verticalAlignment` from `CenterVertically` to `Top` with `1.dp` top padding on the icon — icon now anchors to the first line of multi-line notes.
- `LogForRewardDialog` title: added `color = colorScheme.primary` to match all other dialog titles.

#### Deprecated APIs
- `Icons.Default.ViewList` produces a deprecation warning suggesting `Icons.AutoMirrored.Filled.ViewList` — that icon does not exist in the library. Warning acknowledged; left as-is.

#### Deferred from this pass
- `Color(0xFF2A9D8F)` repeatable icon tint in `LogTaskDialog` (line ~3116) — pre-existing, carried over from Pass 5 deferral.
- Optimal-rewards banner border `Color(0xFFE8A000)` (HomeScreen, ~line 553) — pre-existing warm-gold hardcode, out of scope for this pass.
- `Color(0xFF2A9D8F)` teal gradient on "Done ✓" task state backgrounds (RewardDetailScreen, TaskDetailScreen) — pre-existing.

---

### Pass 8 — `review-point-formula` branch

#### Formula Centralization ✅
- Removed 4 inline copies of `computeAutoPoints` logic from `EarnItApp.kt` — all replaced with `task.effectivePoints()` calls.
- Added `computeAutoPoints()` and `effectivePoints()` as member functions on `TaskEntity` — single source of truth in the data model.
- `EarnItRepository.computeAutoPoints(t,d,p)` kept as a standalone method for unit test access; delegates same logic.

#### Formula Change ✅
- Switched from additive `Time + 2×Difficulty + Preparation` (range 4–20) to shift-by-1 multiplicative with max-dimension bonus:
  `ceil((T+1)(D+1)(P+1)/8) + 3 if any dimension = 5`
  Range: min **1** (all at 1), max **30** (all at 5).
- Rationale: pure additive rewarded individual dimensions equally; multiplicative rewards "doing everything hard." +3 bonus rewards pushing any single dimension to the max.
- `EARNIT_SPEC.md` formula section updated.

#### Tests ✅
- `PointFormulaTest`: all assertions updated for new formula; added `auto point formula max single dimension bonus` test for (5,1,1) = 6 case.

---

### Pass 9 — `widget-size-variants` branch

#### Widget Size Variants ✅
- Added compact widget variant (2×1): reward name + log/claim button only — no progress bar, no numbers visible.
- Both variants share logic via `EarnItBaseWidget` abstract class; `forceCompact` flag selects layout. Standard widget keeps `SizeMode.Exact`; compact uses `SizeMode.Single`.
- Second receiver `EarnItCompactGlanceWidgetReceiver` declared in manifest with its own `earnit_widget_compact_info.xml` — both appear as separate entries in the home screen widget picker.
- Pugsly preview image removed from `earnit_widget_info.xml`.

#### Theme-Aware Widget Colors ✅
- Replaced all hardcoded warm-gold widget colors with a `WidgetColors` data class built from `ColorSchemes.lightColors/darkColors`. Dark mode detected at draw time via `context.resources.configuration.uiMode`.
- `ColorProvider(day, night)` not available in this Glance version — single-color providers used with runtime dark-mode check instead.

#### Widget Claimed State Fix ✅
- Removed Pugsly mascot image from claimed/archived state.
- Now shows reward name + "Earned and Claimed" subtitle. Reward name persisted in widget prefs (`WIDGET_REWARD_NAME_KEY`) at config time; `WidgetConfigActivity` updated to save it alongside the reward ID.

#### Widget Data Refresh ✅
- Widget was not updating when tasks were logged from the main app — Glance widgets do not observe Room flows continuously; they render on demand.
- `EarnItViewModel.logTask()` and `claimReward()` now call `refreshWidgets()` after the database write.
- `WidgetTaskLogActivity` updated to call `updateAll` on both widget types (previously only updated the standard widget).

#### Body Tap ✅
- Tapping anywhere on the standard widget body (outside buttons) now opens the app to the tracked reward.

#### Widget Celebratory Feedback ✅
- **Haptic:** 60ms vibration fires on task log from widget (`VibrationEffect.createOneShot`).
- **Flash:** Widget shows "✓ Logged!" for 3 seconds after a widget log, scoped to the specific reward ID. `WidgetFlash` helper (SharedPrefs + timestamp) handles state; a `Handler.postDelayed` at 3.1s triggers the revert update.
- **Notification:** "Task name / Logged! +X pts" system notification after widget log; silently skipped on Android 13+ if `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` not granted. Notification channel `earnit_widget_log` created in `WidgetTaskLogActivity.onCreate`.
- `VIBRATE` and `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` permissions added to manifest.

#### Bug Fix ✅
- `WidgetTaskLogActivity` task list was showing points using the old additive formula. Fixed to call `task.effectivePoints()`.

#### Spec ✅
- Widget Size Variants and Widget Celebratory Feedback deferred items will be marked complete after merge.

---

### Pass 10 — `split-earnit-app` branch

#### File & Package Structure ✅
- `EarnItApp.kt` split: 4,399 lines → 200 lines (routing + navigation only)
- 13 new focused screen/helper files created in `com.earnit.app.ui`:
  - `AppHelpers.kt` — `hapticTap()`, `formatTimestamp/LogTime/Date()`, `displayPoints()`, `NOTE_MAX_CHARS`
  - `HomeScreen.kt` — `HomeScreen`, `QuoteOfTheDay`, `RewardProgressCard`, slide/fade helpers
  - `RewardDetailScreen.kt` — `RewardDetailScreen`
  - `RewardEditScreen.kt` — `RewardEditScreen`, `AddTaskToRewardDialog`, `TaskEditState`
  - `TasksScreen.kt` — `TasksScreen`, `LogForRewardDialog`
  - `TaskDetailScreen.kt` — `TaskDetailScreen`
  - `TaskEditScreen.kt` — `TaskEditScreen`, `EmojiPickerDialog`, `SliderRow`, `EmojiList`
  - `SharedDialogs.kt` — `LogTaskDialog`, `ClaimDialog`
  - `SettingsScreen.kt` — `SettingsScreen`, `SettingsCard`, `SettingsSectionHeader`, `ThemeChip`, `DangerButton`
  - `AboutScreen.kt` — `AboutScreen`
  - `DataScreen.kt` — `DataScreen`
  - `CleanUpScreen.kt` — `CleanUpScreen`
  - `HistoryScreen.kt` — `HistoryScreen`, `CompletedTasksTab`, `ClaimedRewardsTab`
  - `TaskLibraryScreen.kt` — `TaskLibraryScreen`
- All files in same package (`com.earnit.app.ui`) — no import changes required; cross-file shared symbols use `internal` visibility.
- Pre-Release Checklist item "Split EarnItApp.kt" resolved ✅

#### Design System ✅
- Extracted `CollapsibleGroupHeader` composable into `EarnItButtons.kt` — resolves deferred item from Pass 5. Replaces the copy-pasted collapse/expand row pattern present in `TasksScreen` and `AddTaskToRewardDialog`. Actual call-site replacement deferred (see below) until post-build verification.

#### Spec ✅
- "Buy Me a Coffee" section rewritten as "Tip Jar (In-App Support)" — uses RevenueCat IAP with two consumable products (`tip_small` $2, `tip_coffee` $5). External payment links removed to comply with Google Play Store policy. Implementation deferred to post-release backlog.

#### Task Detail Group Chip ✅
- `TaskDetailScreen` now shows the task's group as a small secondary-coloured chip below the task name. Hidden when the task has no group.

#### Design System ✅
- `CollapsibleGroupHeader` wired into all four live call sites: named groups and "Other" in `TasksScreen`; named groups and "Other" in `AddTaskToRewardDialog` (`RewardEditScreen`). The dialog variant uses the `leadingContent` slot for the select-all `Checkbox`.
- Removed `ExpandLess` and `ExpandMore` imports from both files — now only needed inside `EarnItButtons.kt`.

#### Deferred from this pass
- Snackbar inline strings in `CleanUpScreen` ("Logs cleared", "Tasks cleared", etc.) still inline — carried forward from Pass 6 deferral.
- `CleanupTest` does not assert `historyDao.deleteAllEntries()` on `clearAllLogs()` — carried forward from Pass 6 deferral.

---

### Pass 11 — widget UX polish & flash fix

#### Animation Timing ✅
- Floating `+X` label: travel extended to −60 dp, duration 1200 ms (`FastOutSlowInEasing`). Alpha fade decoupled — starts after 500 ms delay, runs 700 ms. Applied to both `HomeScreen` and `RewardDetailScreen`.

#### RadioButton Alignment Fix ✅
- `LogTaskDialog` (`SharedDialogs.kt`): `RadioButton` had no explicit size, so Compose inflated its 48 dp touch target into the row height, pushing the radio onto its own line for single-line task names. Fixed with `Modifier.size(24.dp)` to clip to the visual circle. `verticalAlignment = Alignment.Top` with matching `padding(top = 2.dp)` on all three row elements.

#### Widget Theme Fix ✅
- Both `WidgetTaskLogActivity` and `WidgetConfigActivity` called `EarnItTheme` without a `colorScheme` argument, always rendering in `WARM_GOLD` regardless of the user's setting. Fixed by adding `ThemedTaskPicker` and `ThemedWidgetConfig` composable wrappers that read `viewModel.settings.collectAsState()` and pass the selected scheme explicitly.

#### Widget Flash Stuck Fix ✅
- Prior mechanism: detached `CoroutineScope` with `delay(3000L)` + `updateAll()`. On process death (every APK reinstall, system memory pressure), the coroutine was killed and the widget stayed stuck on "Logged!" indefinitely.
- New mechanism: `produceState` timer inside `WidgetContent` reads `WidgetFlash.remainingMs()` and self-schedules a `delay()` to flip `showFlash = false`. Runs within the Glance composition lifecycle, independent of the app process. Added `remainingMs()` to `WidgetFlash`.
- `WidgetTaskLogActivity.onCreate()` calls `updateAll()` on both widget types at startup to clear any stale flash before the user logs a new task.
- `onTaskLogged` detached coroutine simplified — `delay(3000L)` + second `updateAll()` removed.

#### Widget Success Screen ✅
- After tapping "Log task" in `WidgetTaskLogActivity`, the activity now shows a brief success screen (✓, task name, +X pts) for 1.5 s before auto-closing via `LaunchedEffect` + `delay`. Gives the user visible confirmation without any extra tap.

#### Code Hygiene ✅
- Import `kotlinx.coroutines.delay` was placed out of order (between compose UI and core imports) — moved to its correct group with the other `kotlinx.coroutines.*` imports.
- Removed explain-what comment from `ThemedTaskPicker` — the function name is self-describing.

#### `NoteScreen` consistency fix ✅
- Widget note field had no character limit. `LogTaskDialog` and `LogForRewardDialog` both enforce `NOTE_MAX_CHARS = 200`. Fixed: `onValueChange` now guards with `it.length <= NOTE_MAX_CHARS` and a `supportingText` counter shows `X/200`.
- `note` state changed from `remember` to `rememberSaveable` — text now survives configuration changes (e.g. device rotation).

#### Deferred from this pass
- Widget thorough review and automated testing — added to Deferred Ideas in `EARNIT_SPEC.md`. `WidgetFlash` unit tests and `TaskPickerScreen` filter logic are the highest-value quick wins.
- Inline user-visible strings in widget activities (`WidgetTaskLogActivity`, `WidgetConfigActivity`) not yet in `Strings.kt` — consistent with the rest of the codebase; carried to pre-release checklist alongside the existing CleanUpScreen inline strings deferral.

---

### Pass 12 — group picker UX redesign & sort fix

#### Group Picker Redesign ✅
- `TaskEditScreen` group section is now collapsible via `CollapsibleGroupHeader` — expanded by default, collapses to "Group · [name]" or "Group (optional)" summary.
- "New group..." is the last row inside the bordered box — a `BasicTextField` with a matching `RadioButton`, visually unified with the existing group rows. No separate button or external text field.
- Selecting an existing group radio clears the `newGroupText` field; typing in "New group..." clears the radio selection. Both remain mutually exclusive via separate `group` and `newGroupText` state vars.
- Save action resolves final group as `newGroupText.ifBlank { group }`.
- Removed `showCustomGroupField` state var, `isCustomGroup` and `showGroupTextField` derived values — logic simplified.
- Removed `HorizontalDivider` dividers between radio rows — cleaner list appearance.
- Added imports: `BasicTextField`, `FocusRequester`, `focusRequester`, `SolidColor`.
- Removed imports: `HorizontalDivider`, `Icons.Default.Add`.

#### Sort Fix ✅
- "Complete to earn points" task list in `RewardDetailScreen`: tasks are now sorted alphabetically within each group (mandatory A→Z first, optional A→Z after). Previously insertion order.

#### Deferred from this pass
- "New group..." placeholder and "Group (optional)" label are inline strings — carry forward to pre-release Strings.kt pass.
- `FocusRequester` placed at the form Column scope; if `TaskEditScreen` is ever split further, ensure it stays outside any conditional block.

---

### Pass 13 — `export-import-backup` branch

#### Auto Backup ✅
- Added `res/xml/data_extraction_rules.xml` — includes `earnit.db` (Room) and `datastore/` (DataStore preferences) in both cloud backup and device transfer.
- Added `android:dataExtractionRules="@xml/data_extraction_rules"` to `AndroidManifest.xml`. `android:allowBackup="true"` was already set.

#### File-based Export / Import ✅
- `EarnItRepository`: added `exportToFile(context, uri)` and `importFromFile(context, uri, replace)` — thin wrappers around the existing `exportToJson`/`importFromJson` using `ContentResolver` streams.
- `EarnItViewModel`: added matching `exportToFile` and `importFromFile` wrappers; removed now-dead `exportDatabase` and `importDatabase` (clipboard-based) methods.
- `DataScreen`: replaced clipboard export + paste text field with `ActivityResultContracts.CreateDocument` (export) and `ActivityResultContracts.GetContent` (import Replace / Merge). Suggested export filename: `earnit_backup_YYYY-MM-DD.json`.

#### Spec ✅
- Section 7 rewritten to cover Auto Backup, file-based Export, and file-based Import.
- "File-based Export / Import" removed from Deferred Ideas.

---

### Pass 14 — `mascot-system` branch

#### Mascot System ✅
- `AppSettings`: `pugslyEnabled: Boolean` replaced with `selectedMascotId: MascotId?` + `unlockedMascotIds: Set<MascotId>`.
- `SettingsRepository`: DataStore migration — legacy `show_pugsly` key read on first launch, then `selected_mascot_id` / `unlocked_mascot_ids` used going forward.
- `Mascots.kt` (new): `MascotDef` list with 9 slots; 5 have artwork (Pugsly, Tabby, Panda, Penguin, Otter, Capybara). Unlock logic is pure data — no constants in ViewModel.
- `EarnItViewModel`: `checkAndUnlockMascots()` fires after every claim; uses `totalClaims + 1` offset because the Room Flow hasn't propagated the new history entry at check time. Emits `newlyUnlockedMascot` SharedFlow and `triggerMascotBounce` SharedFlow.
- `SettingsScreen`: Mascot picker row opens `MascotPickerDialog` — 3×3 grid, locked slots show unlock hint only (name hidden), unlocked slots show avatar + name + checkmark if selected. Toggle switch hides mascot (sets `null`).
- `HomeScreen`: Mascot resolved dynamically from `selectedMascotId` + color scheme. Bounces (scale 1.0 → 1.3 → spring back) on every reward claim via `triggerMascotBounce` collection.
- `EarnItApp`: Unlock snackbar with `Strings.MASCOT_UNLOCK_ACTION` action label navigates to Settings on tap.

#### Dead Strings ✅
- Removed `MASCOT_LOCKED_LABEL` from `Strings.kt` — became dead after locked slots were changed to show only the unlock hint (no "Locked" label text).
- Removed `MASCOT_UNLOCK_CTA` from `Strings.kt` — defined but never referenced.
- Moved inline `"Mascots"` snackbar action label to `Strings.MASCOT_UNLOCK_ACTION`.

#### Asset Pipeline ✅
- `recolor_pug.py`: added `--strength` parameter (0.0–1.0) to scale hue shift — needed for mostly black-and-white mascots (Panda: 0.3, Penguin: 0.35). Script now resizes the base image to 512×512 in place if not already that size, and outputs variants at 512×512 with `compress_level=9`.
- All mascot images resized from 2048×2048 to 512×512 — total drawable size reduced from ~17 MB to ~3.4 MB (~80% reduction).

#### Deferred from this pass
- `recolor_pug.py` move to `/tools` — already on Pre-Release Checklist.
- Mascot slots 7–9: artwork TBD.
- Bounce animation values (1.3f, 150ms, spring params) are inline — consistent with other animation constants in the codebase; acceptable.

---

### Pass 15 — mascot polish, task library expansion, UI animations

#### Inline Strings ✅
- `SettingsScreen.kt` (`MascotPickerDialog`): `"Show mascot"` → `Strings.MASCOT_PICKER_TITLE`, `"Done"` → `Strings.MASCOT_PICKER_DONE`, `"NEW"` badge → `Strings.MASCOT_NEW_BADGE`.
- `RewardEditScreen.kt` (Add Task empty state): `"No tasks yet."` → `Strings.ADD_TASK_EMPTY`, `"Create your own"` → `Strings.ADD_TASK_CREATE`, `"browse the Library"` → `Strings.ADD_TASK_BROWSE`.

#### Startup Unlock Check Timing ✅
- `HomeScreen.kt` `LaunchedEffect(Unit)`: added `viewModel.uiState.drop(1).first()` before calling `runStartupUnlockCheck()`. The UI is actively collecting `uiState` at this point so `WhileSubscribed` is live — safe to wait for the first Room emission. Without this, the check fired on the initial `EarnItUiState()` default value (empty) and would miss any mascots that should have unlocked.

#### Deferred from this pass
- `DataScreen.kt` inline strings (`"Load test data"`, `"Load full test data"`, descriptions) — test data section is now hidden behind dev mode; not worth moving.
- `"or"` connector in Add Task empty state — single word, context-only, no translation needed.
- Empty-state pulse animation magic numbers (`1.12f`, `900ms`) — consistent with existing animation constants in the codebase.
- Pre-existing hardcoded banner colors in `HomeScreen.kt` — carried from Pass 7 deferral.

---

### Pass 16 — bug fixes, Add Task shortcut, and button style system

#### Bug Fixes ✅
- **`copyRewardFromEntry` lost icon, wrong `sortOrder`/`createdAt`:** bypassed `upsertReward` → icon dropped and new reward pinned to top. Routed through `upsertReward` with `icon = entry.rewardIcon`.
- **`RewardDetailScreen` activity log showed "Task" for deleted tasks:** `task?.name ?: "Task"` → `task?.name ?: log.taskName` (uses snapshotted name, matching `CompletedTasksTab` pattern).
- **LOG button enabled when `loggableTasks` empty:** `rp.allTasks.isNotEmpty()` → `rp.loggableTasks.isNotEmpty()` — tapping LOG no longer opens an empty dialog.
- **Nickname defaults to "Babe" when user clears it:** `?.takeIf { it.isNotEmpty() } ?: "Babe"` removed — `""` is now stored and respected; greeting shows "Earn It!" with no address.
- **Task name truncated on Task Detail:** removed `maxLines = 1` + `TextOverflow.Ellipsis`; inner Row changed to `Alignment.Top` so icon anchors to first line.
- **Points hidden for long task names in Reward Detail task list:** task name `Text` given `Modifier.weight(1f)`; removed `Spacer(weight(1f))` that was taking space from the name.

#### Features ✅
- **Add Task shortcut on Reward Detail:** `AddTaskToRewardDialog` moved from `RewardEditScreen.kt` to `SharedDialogs.kt`; `addTaskToReward()` added to `EarnItViewModel`; full-width "Add task" `EarnItOutlinedButton` added inside the "Complete to earn points" section — writes to DB immediately (no deferred save).
- **Save/Cancel stay on screen after save:** removed `navController.popBackStack()` from Save action in both `RewardEditScreen` and `TaskEditScreen` — snackbar confirms save, user navigates back manually.
- **Compact widget removed:** `EarnItCompactGlanceWidget`, `EarnItCompactGlanceWidgetReceiver`, manifest entry, and `earnit_widget_compact_info.xml` deleted. `EarnItBaseWidget` abstract class collapsed into `EarnItGlanceWidget`.
- **Widget custom label (privacy):** `WidgetConfigActivity` is now a two-step flow — pick reward → edit label. Label is pre-filled with the reward name but fully editable; stored in `widget_reward_name`. The actual reward name in the app is unaffected.
- **Button style system:** `buttonLabelStyle` `@Composable` property added to `AppHelpers.kt`; `EarnItPrimaryButton` and `EarnItOutlinedButton` added to `EarnItButtons.kt`. All primary action buttons (`SAVE`, `LOG`, `ADD SELECTED`, `ADD WIDGET`, `REPLACE ALL`, `OK`) and cancel buttons migrated. Raw `Button(` without explicit colours eliminated from production code.
- **Golden button dark-text fix:** Root cause was Warm Gold `onPrimary = Color(0xFF3D2900)` (dark brown). `EarnItPrimaryButton` uses explicit `contentColor = Color.White`. `TaskLibraryScreen` "OK" button fixed. `DataScreen` "REPLACE ALL" fixed.
- **Small caps convention applied to Save/Cancel:** `RewardEditScreen` and `TaskEditScreen` bottom bar buttons now use `buttonLabelStyle`.

#### Test Updates ✅
- `RepositoryBehaviourTest`: existing `copyRewardFromEntry` test updated to add `getMaxSortOrder()` mock (required after fix); new test `copyRewardFromEntry copies icon and appends reward to end of list` added.
- `TestDataSeeder.seedFull`: `history()` helper extended with optional `notes` parameter; 12 of 20 history entries now seed realistic notes to exercise the note display in Claimed Rewards history.

#### Dead Code ✅
- `RewardEditScreen.kt`: removed unused `background`, `clickable`, `Box` imports (only used by the now-deleted Save Box).
- `TaskEditScreen.kt`: removed unused `shadow` import.
- `SharedDialogs.kt`, `TasksScreen.kt`, `TaskLibraryScreen.kt`, `DataScreen.kt`: removed now-unused `Button` (and where applicable `ButtonDefaults`, `Color`) imports after migration to `EarnItPrimaryButton`.
- `EarnItWidget.kt`: removed unused `LocalSize` import (was only used by deleted `CompactContent`); removed `COMPACT_WIDTH` constant; removed `CompactContent` composable; removed `EarnItCompactGlanceWidget`, `EarnItCompactGlanceWidgetReceiver`.

#### Spec ✅
- Section 5 Widget: Compact variant removed; Configuration updated to two-step flow with custom label description.
- Section 6 Settings: Nickname note added — clearing stores `""`, greeting shows "Earn It!" with no address.
- Section 10 Screen Map: Reward Detail Add Task shortcut; Save-stays-on-screen for both edit screens; widget WidgetConfigActivity two-step description.
- Deferred Ideas: Widget review updated — compact variant references removed, custom label two-step flow and privacy testing added.

#### Deferred from this pass
- `Color(0xFF2A9D8F)` repeatable icon tint in `LogTaskDialog` — pre-existing, carried forward.
- `LogPillButton` disabled-state warm-gold neutral colours — pre-existing, carried forward.
- Progress bar background hardcoded warm-gold Canvas colours — pre-existing, carried forward.
- Pre-existing hardcoded banner colours in `HomeScreen.kt` — carried forward.
- `CleanupTest` missing `historyDao.deleteAllEntries()` assertion — already added in Pass 16; checklist item was stale.

---

### Pass 17 — `prerelease/checklist-and-deps` branch

#### File & Package Structure ✅
- `prep_mascot.py` moved from repo root to `tools/prep_mascot.py`. `tools/README.md` added documenting the script and its Pillow dependency.
- Root dir audit: clean — no stray planning files or scripts. `.gitignore` extended with `*.keystore`, `*.jks` (signing keys), `__pycache__/`, and `*.pyc` (Python artifacts from tools/).

#### Inline Strings ✅
- `CleanUpScreen.kt`: all 4 snackbar messages, 4 dialog titles, 4 dialog body texts, 4 card descriptions, and 4 button labels moved to `Strings.kt`.
- `WidgetTaskLogActivity.kt`: notification body text, notification channel name, task picker hint, "All tasks logged" empty state, note screen label, note placeholder, "Log task" and "Back" button labels moved to `Strings.kt`.
- `WidgetConfigActivity.kt`: reward picker title, subtitle, empty state, widget label screen title, label hint, reward name display, and "ADD WIDGET" button label moved to `Strings.kt`.

#### Code Quality Audits ✅
- **`LaunchedEffect` keys**: all 13 occurrences reviewed. All keys are correct. The two edit-screen initialization effects use guard variables (`taskStateReady`, `containsKey`) that prevent over-triggering. No changes needed.
- **`remember` vs `rememberSaveable`**: `TasksScreen.query` upgraded to `rememberSaveable` — search text now survives device rotation.
- **Known limitation (not fixed):** `taskState` (RewardEditScreen) and `rewardLinkState` (TaskEditScreen) are `remember { mutableStateMapOf() }`. These maps lose task-link checkbox state on rotation. Fixing requires a custom `mapSaver` for `rememberSaveable` — deferred; acceptable pre-release.

#### KAPT → KSP Migration ✅
- Removed `org.jetbrains.kotlin.kapt` plugin from both `build.gradle.kts` files.
- Added `com.google.devtools.ksp` version `1.9.23-1.0.20` to root build file; applied in app module.
- Migrated all three annotation processors:
  - `kapt(room-compiler:2.6.1)` → `ksp(room-compiler:2.6.1)`
  - `kapt(hilt-compiler:2.51.1)` → `ksp(hilt-android-compiler:2.51.1)` (also corrected artifact name from `hilt-compiler` to `hilt-android-compiler` per official Hilt KSP docs)
  - `kapt(moshi-kotlin-codegen:1.15.0)` → `ksp(moshi-kotlin-codegen:1.15.0)`

#### SDK Version Bump ✅
- `compileSdk` and `targetSdk` bumped from 34 → 35 (Android 15). Required by Google Play for new apps/updates.

#### Deferred from this pass
- AGP upgrade (8.13.2 has an upgrade available) — use **AGP Upgrade Assistant** in Android Studio; handles Gradle wrapper and cascading changes automatically. Do not migrate manually.
- Kotlin upgrade (1.9.23 → 2.x) — requires updating the Compose compiler plugin format (new in Kotlin 2.0) and all Compose/lifecycle dependencies. Bundle with a Compose version upgrade.
- Compose upgrade (1.5.x → current) — must move with Kotlin since Compose compiler extension version is Kotlin-version-locked. Test thoroughly on emulator after upgrading.
- `TestDataSeeder.kt` removal — kept intentionally for ongoing development; hidden behind dev mode instead of removed.

---

### Pass 18 — `feature/about-screen-support` branch

#### About Screen — Support Features ✅
- `TipRepository` interface + `MockTipRepository` added to `data/` — all RevenueCat types will stay behind this interface; `AppModule` provides the mock until real integration is done
- `TipViewModel` added to `viewmodel/` — `TipState` (Loading / Ready / Error) StateFlow, `PurchaseEvent` SharedFlow; `purchase()` takes `Activity` for future billing sheet
- `AboutScreen` redesigned: replaced static "Buy me a coffee" row with three new sections:
  - **Rate the app** — tappable row, opens `market://` URI with HTTPS fallback
  - **Get in touch** — tappable row, fires `ACTION_SENDTO` mailto intent
  - **Support the developer** — loading indicator while prices fetch, two `EarnItPrimaryButton` instances with dynamic price labels, thank-you/error snackbar via local `Scaffold`
- `EarnItApp`: collects `triggerInAppReview` SharedFlow; calls `ReviewManagerFactory` + `launchReviewFlow` — silently no-ops in debug, fires on Play Store installs

#### In-App Review Trigger ✅
- `EarnItViewModel.claimReward` captures `isFirstClaim = uiState.value.historyEntries.isEmpty()` before the DB write; emits `_triggerInAppReview` only on first-ever claim

#### Strings ✅
- All About screen and tip copy centralised in `Strings.kt` — `ABOUT_RATE_LABEL`, `ABOUT_RATE_SUBTITLE`, `ABOUT_CONTACT_LABEL`, `ABOUT_CONTACT_SUBTITLE`, `ABOUT_CONTACT_EMAIL`, `ABOUT_TIP_TITLE`, `ABOUT_TIP_COPY`, `TIP_SUCCESS`, `TIP_ERROR`, `TIP_LOAD_ERROR`

#### Dependencies ✅
- `com.google.android.play:review-ktx:2.0.1` added to `build.gradle.kts`

#### Spec ✅
- Section 10 Screen Map: About entry updated with full description of new sections
- Tip Jar deferred entry rewritten: what's built vs. what RevenueCat integration still needs
- "How to get feedback from users" deferred entry replaced with description of implemented behaviour

#### Deferred from this pass
- RevenueCat integration — `MockTipRepository` is the placeholder; see Tip Jar deferred entry in spec for the full integration steps
- `Strings.ABOUT_CONTACT_EMAIL` — placeholder at time of writing; updated to `hello@secondmondaystudios.com` in Pass 21
- In-app review unit tests — 2 tests for `claimReward` trigger condition (see TESTING.md)
- `TipViewModel` state tests — low priority until RevenueCat replaces mock

---

### Pass 19 — `fix/about-screen-design-review` branch

#### Icon ✅
- `AboutActionRow`: `Icons.AutoMirrored.Filled.NavigateNext` → `Icons.Default.ChevronRight` — now matches every other navigation row in the app

#### Colour ✅
- `AboutActionRow` chevron tint: `colorScheme.primary` → `colorScheme.onSurfaceVariant` — consistent with `SettingsScreen` (3 rows) and `TaskDetailScreen`

#### Strings ✅
- `"The idea"` section header moved to `Strings.ABOUT_THE_IDEA_TITLE`
- Placeholder body text moved to `Strings.ABOUT_THE_IDEA_PLACEHOLDER` — easy to find when real copy is written
- `Strings.ABOUT_TEASER` updated from `"Why this app exists — and a note from the maker."` to `"The story behind the app, plus support and feedback options."` — now accurately reflects the full About screen

#### Safety ✅
- `context as Activity` (tip button `onClick`) changed to `(context as? Activity)?.let { ... }` — safe cast, no-op if context is not an Activity

#### Accessibility ✅
- `AboutActionRow`: added `Modifier.heightIn(min = 48.dp)` — guarantees minimum touch target regardless of content

#### Code quality ✅
- `CircularProgressIndicator`: removed redundant `color = MaterialTheme.colorScheme.primary` — that is already the M3 default

---

### Pass 20 — `fix/tasklibrary-tasks-design-review` branch

#### TaskLibraryScreen ✅
- **Button**: Raw `OutlinedButton` with inline styling → `EarnItPrimaryButton` — brings ADD into the design system (Pass 16 migration was incomplete here)
- **Top bar title**: `titleLarge + Bold` → `titleMedium + ExtraBold` — matches every other sub-screen top bar
- **Back arrow tint**: no tint (default `onSurface`) → `colorScheme.primary` — consistent with AboutScreen, CleanUpScreen
- **Inline strings → Strings.kt**: `LIBRARY_TITLE`, `libraryTaskCount()`, `libraryGroupHint()`, `libraryAddButton()`, `librarySkippedTitle()`, `librarySkippedBody()`

#### TasksScreen ✅
- **TaskCard composable extracted**: identical card layout was duplicated verbatim 3× (named group, Other group, flat list) — now a single private `TaskCard(task, accent, onClick, modifier, isDragging)` composable; drag modifier and elevated shadow on drag still passed in from flat-list call site
- **First group expanded by default**: `collapsedGroups[groupName] ?: true` → `?: (groupIndex != 0)` — first alphabetical group opens on first load; all others remain collapsed
- **"Other" expanded when sole section**: `collapsedGroups[null] ?: true` → `?: namedGroups.isNotEmpty()` — when no named groups exist "Other" opens automatically
- **Inline strings → Strings.kt**: `TASKS_EMPTY_TITLE`, `TASKS_EMPTY_BODY`, `TASKS_GROUP_OTHER`, `TASKS_GROUP_ASSIGN_HINT`, `TASKS_SEARCH_HINT`, `TASKS_LIBRARY_BTN`

---

### Pass 21 — pre-publish cleanup

#### Branding ✅
- All "Cedar Inlet Apps" references replaced with "SecondMonday Studios" across `Strings.kt`, `CLEANUP.md`, `LAUNCH_SETUP.md`, `EARNIT_SPEC.md`
- `Strings.ABOUT_CONTACT_EMAIL` set to `hello@secondmondaystudios.com`

#### Dev Mode — TestDataSeeder hidden ✅
- `AppSettings`: added `devModeEnabled: Boolean = false`
- `SettingsRepository`: added `DEV_MODE_ENABLED` DataStore key + `enableDevMode()` suspend function
- `EarnItViewModel`: added `enableDevMode()` wrapper
- `AboutScreen`: tapping the version text 7 times triggers `enableDevMode()` + snackbar confirmation; no-ops if already enabled
- `DataScreen`: "Load test data" and "Load full test data" cards gated behind `settings.devModeEnabled` — hidden by default, no removal needed

#### Tip Jar hidden behind feature flag ✅
- `FeatureFlags.kt` added: `TIP_JAR_ENABLED = false`
- `AboutScreen` "Support the developer" section wrapped in `if (FeatureFlags.TIP_JAR_ENABLED)`
- All tip infrastructure (`TipViewModel`, `TipRepository`, `MockTipRepository`) retained for when RevenueCat is wired

#### Hardcoded Colors ✅
- `SharedDialogs.kt` repeatable icon: `Color(0xFF2A9D8F)` → `colorScheme.secondary`
- `HomeScreen.kt` optimal-rewards banner: background `Color(0xFFFFF3CD)` → `colorScheme.primaryContainer`, border `Color(0xFFE8A000)` → `colorScheme.primary`, text `Color(0xFF5C3D00)` → `colorScheme.onPrimaryContainer`
- `HistoryScreen.kt` card palette: inline `listOf(Color(...))` → `LocalEarnItAccents.current.cardPalette`
- `HistoryScreen.kt` "Earn Again" button: `Brush.horizontalGradient(teal)` → `colorScheme.secondary` (solid, consistent with Pass 7 button migration)
- `RewardDetailScreen.kt` + `TaskDetailScreen.kt` edit buttons: same teal gradient → `colorScheme.secondary`
- Removed now-unused `Brush` import from `HistoryScreen.kt`

#### Git housekeeping ✅
- `.gitignore` extended: `.claude/`, `.vscode/`
- `.claude/settings.local.json` untracked (contained only local paths + permission rules, no secrets)
- `feature/ui-tests` merged into `master`

---

### Pass 22 — empty-state UI journey

#### Tests ✅
- Added `EmptyStateUiTest.kt` — UI journey covering the "no tasks, no rewards, no history" fresh-install state across all three tabs (Prizes, Tasks, History × both sub-tabs). Closes the "Empty-state screens" gap previously listed as not covered in `TESTING.md`.
- Added `TaskLibraryImportUiTest.kt` — UI journey covering Task Library template import (expand "Healthy Living", add all 10 tasks, verify they land in the Tasks list). Closes the "UI journey: task library import" pre-release checklist item.
- Fixed `SettingsUiTest.kt` — `colorScheme_selectionPersistsAfterRecreate` referenced `settingsRepository.appSettings`, a property that no longer exists (renamed to `settings`). This compile error was pre-existing and unrelated to this pass; it blocked the whole `androidTest` source set from compiling.

#### Dependency Fix ✅
- `espresso-core` bumped `3.5.1` → `3.7.0` — `3.5.1` calls `InputManager.getInstance()` via reflection, which was removed on Android 16 (API 36), crashing every instrumented test on devices running it. Verified the fix removes that crash; tried `3.6.1` first as the more conservative bump but it still hit the same `NoSuchMethodException`.

#### Documentation ✅
- Added a "Manual-Only Test Plan" section to `TESTING.md` for the three journeys that cross a system-process boundary (export/import file picker, widget activity chain, Play Core review API) and were never going to be automated — not just temporarily deferred. Each entry states why it's manual, how often to run it, and step-by-step instructions.
- `DEV_PLAYBOOK.md` Manual Testing section now points to that plan instead of duplicating brief one-liners; the Tests section's two remaining checklist items (export/import UI journey, widget log flow) were removed since they're now formally manual-only rather than pending automation.

#### Known Gap — flagged, not fixed
- Live instrumented-test verification is currently blocked on physical Android 16 (API 36) devices by a separate, deeper issue: `ComposeTestRule` reports `IllegalStateException: No compose hierarchies found in the app` even after a successful `MainActivity` launch. Reproduced on the pre-existing `UiHappyPathTest` too, so it's not specific to the new test. Ruled out: espresso version (3.6.1/3.7.0 both affected), compose-bom patch bump (2026.05.00 → 2026.05.01, no change), timing (2s sleep + `waitForIdle()` before the first assertion, no change). Real fix is most likely a CI/emulator pinned to a stable API level (34/35) rather than chasing API-36-specific compatibility — see `DEV_PLAYBOOK.md` Known Limitations.

---

### Pass 23 — ktlint adoption

#### Linting ✅
- Added `org.jlleitschuh.gradle.ktlint` (14.2.0) to the root `build.gradle.kts`, applied to all subprojects. Closes the "Linting" pre-release checklist item.
- Decided to reformat the entire codebase to ktlint's default style in one mechanical commit, rather than disabling rules to preserve the project's prior hand-aligned-column style. Rationale: disabling the conflicting rules wouldn't actually *enforce* the alignment style going forward, only stop ktlint from commenting on it — new code could still drift with nothing to catch it. A default config also needs no explanation for an outside reader, which matters for a portfolio repo.
- `.editorconfig` added with two narrow exceptions ktlint's defaults don't account for: `ktlint_function_naming_ignore_when_annotated_with` includes `Composable` (PascalCase composables) and `Test`/`Before`/`After`/etc. (snake_case test names, a standard Kotlin testing convention). `max_line_length` raised to 180 — the ~17 lines that exceeded 120 were almost all long string literals (copy text, content descriptions) where wrapping would hurt readability more than help.
- `ktlintFormat` couldn't auto-fix wildcard imports (`import com.earnit.app.data.*`, `import io.mockk.*`, `import org.junit.Assert.*`, `import androidx.room.*`, `import androidx.datastore.preferences.core.*`) — expanded all of them to explicit imports by hand across ~16 files. Caught and fixed several explicit-import mistakes this introduced (e.g. mockk's `capture`/`slot` are members of `MockKMatcherScope`, resolved via the implicit receiver inside `every {}` blocks, not top-level — importing `io.mockk.capture` as if it were a top-level function compiles the import line but fails at the call site).
- Verified `ktlintCheck` (zero violations), `assembleDebug`, `compileDebugAndroidTestKotlin`, and the full unit test suite (79 tests) all pass after the reformat — confirms the change is purely mechanical, no logic touched.

#### Secrets Grep ✅
- `git log -p | grep -iE "key|secret|password|storeFile"` across full history — clean. Every hit is either a reference to the grep command itself in checklist docs, harmless code (`KeyboardOptions`, `LazyColumn key=`, DataStore `Keys` object, Room `@PrimaryKey`/`@ForeignKey`), or the gitignored `keystore.properties.template` placeholder with empty values. Closes the "Secrets grep" pre-release checklist item.

---

### Pass 24 — repo structure review

#### Branch & Git Hygiene ✅
- Renamed local `master` → `main`. No `main` branch existed before this; GitHub now defaults new repos to `main`, and the checklist text already assumed that name in places.
- Confirmed all 16 pre-existing local branches (including `pre-release-config`) are fully merged into `main` — `git branch --merged` showed nothing outstanding. Safe to delete; left for the Clear Git State pass.
- Found `local.properties` tracked in git despite being listed in `.gitignore` — it predates that rule. Contains a machine-specific SDK path, not a secret, but meaningless to any other clone. Flagged in `DEV_PLAYBOOK.md` Code & Repo Hygiene for `git rm --cached` during the Clear Git State pass; not removed in this pass to keep the diff scoped to structure/docs.

#### Dead Code & Hygiene ✅
- `EarnItRepository.kt:313` and `TestDataSeeder.kt:1` both had `// TEST DATA — remove before release` comments that contradicted the actual decision made in Pass 21 (hide behind `Settings.devModeEnabled`, don't remove). Updated both to describe what's actually true.

#### Documentation Restructure ✅
- Created `docs/` and moved `EARNIT_SPEC.md`, `TESTING.md`, `DEV_PLAYBOOK.md`, `CLEANUP_LOG.md` into it as a group — all four files only ever cross-link each other by bare filename, so the move didn't break any links.
- Split the Manual-Only Test Plan out of `TESTING.md` into its own `docs/MANUAL_TEST_PLAN.md`. Rationale: it's a different kind of document from the rest of `TESTING.md` — an operational runbook read during release QA, not a strategy doc read by developers/CI. `TESTING.md` now points to it instead of containing it.
- Added a "Test Cadence" section to `TESTING.md` consolidating when each test layer runs (previously scattered: one line under the pyramid, per-item cadence notes only inside the manual plan). Flagged that most rows will need updating once CI/CD Workflows 1–2 exist.
- Updated `DEV_PLAYBOOK.md`'s repo-structure-review checklist bullet to reflect the new root layout (`CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `docs/` instead of the four docs sitting at root) and to reference `MANUAL_TEST_PLAN.md` alongside `TESTING.md` everywhere the old single-file link was inlined.
- Added `CLAUDE.md` at repo root — project-specific instructions for AI assistants (collaboration rules, branch convention, pointers to the `docs/` source-of-truth files, common commands). This was previously living only in an external memory store outside the repo; checking it in makes the AI-assisted workflow visible and functional for any tool reading the repo, and doubles as a portfolio artifact for the README's "AI-assisted development workflow" section.

---

### Pass 25 — DEV_PLAYBOOK.md review

#### Documentation ✅
- Promoted "Known Limitations" from a `###` subsection of the Pre-Release Checklist to its own `## 3. Known Limitations` section (Tooling Upgrade Reference renumbered §3 → §4). It was sitting under a heading that says "everything here must be resolved before shipping," which directly contradicted what the section actually contains — permanent, accepted constraints that are never going to be "resolved." Only `§1 Post-Work Cleanup` is referenced by number elsewhere (`CLAUDE.md`, this file's own template instructions), so the renumbering doesn't break anything.
- Reclassified the Android 16 instrumented-test gap: it isn't a permanent limitation, it's resolved by finishing CI/CD Workflow 2 (pinning a stable emulator API level). Moved the explanation from Known Limitations into a note on that checklist bullet instead, where it belongs as context for the fix rather than a thing being permanently accepted.
- Added a Manual Test Plan pointer to the Post-Work Cleanup → Tests checklist: any new flow that crosses a system-process boundary (file picker, widget activity chain, Play-Store-only API) should be routed to `MANUAL_TEST_PLAN.md` going forward instead of being left silently untested.

---

### Pass 27 — mascot unlock UX fixes

#### Duplication ✅
- No new duplication introduced. Converted `_openMascotPicker` from `SharedFlow` to `StateFlow`, making it consistent with `_pendingTaskId` (already a StateFlow) — removed the one remaining inconsistency in how one-shot ViewModel state is modelled.

#### Decoupling ✅
- `EarnItBottomBar` receives `hasNewMascot: Boolean` rather than the full ViewModel, keeping the composable's dependency surface minimal.

#### Complexity & Pattern Health ✅
- `LaunchedEffect(currentRoute)` key is correct: re-triggers on every route change, which is the intended dismissal and badge-clear trigger.
- `StateFlow` for `openMascotPicker` is simpler and more predictable than the previous SharedFlow — eliminates the replay/buffer edge case that caused Bug 1.
- The `uiState.drop(1).first()` pattern in `importFromFile` follows the same established pattern in `HomeScreen`'s startup check.

#### Dead Code & Hygiene ✅
- `ktlintFormat` applied; all imports clean. No unused symbols.

#### Naming Consistency ✅
- `consumeMascotPickerId`, `clearNewMascotBadge`, `hasNewMascot`, `MASCOT_SETTINGS_BADGE` all follow existing naming patterns in ViewModel and `Strings.kt`.

#### Hardcoded Values ✅
- Badge label `"!"` extracted to `Strings.MASCOT_SETTINGS_BADGE` (flagged by cleanup checklist; fixed in same pass).

#### Accessibility ✅
- `BadgedBox` is an M3 component with built-in accessibility semantics. Settings icon retains its `contentDescription = "Settings"`.

#### Spec Review ✅
- Added "Mascot Unlock Notifications" subsection to `EARNIT_SPEC.md` covering snackbar, badge, and import suppression — these behaviours existed in code but were undocumented.
- Updated screen map Settings entry to mention the `!` badge.
- Updated test count (79 → 82, 13 → 14 test files).

#### Tests ✅
- Added `MascotNotificationTest` (3 tests): badge set on unlock, badge not set when all already unlocked, import silently seeds without notification.
- Updated `TESTING.md` counts and table.
- Added import-suppression verification step to `MANUAL_TEST_PLAN.md`.

---

### Pass 26 — trim Ship Checklist

#### Documentation ✅
- Removed the "Code & Repo Hygiene" subsection from the Pre-Release Checklist. It was mostly a one-time pre-publish gate already completed this session (root-file review, `pre-release-config` merge — both recorded in Pass 24/25) or a duplicate of checks `§1 Post-Work Cleanup` already has (TODO/seed-data hygiene). The two genuinely repeatable checks moved into `§1`: a `git status` clean check (Dead Code & Hygiene) and a package-placement check (Naming Consistency) — both now apply to every future pass, not just the one-time pre-publish review.
- Removed the "Tests" subsection from the Pre-Release Checklist — it had already been reduced to a pure pointer ("see TESTING.md / MANUAL_TEST_PLAN.md") with no actionable content of its own, and both docs are already referenced from `CLAUDE.md` and from `§1`'s Tests checklist.
- Collapsed "Manual Testing" from a paragraph + three itemized journeys down to a single pointer line. The three journeys, their rationale, and their cadence already live in `MANUAL_TEST_PLAN.md`; duplicating the enumeration here just meant two places to keep in sync. Kept one line (rather than removing the section outright) so the Pre-Release Checklist — the actual "what's left before shipping" document — still carries a trigger to run the manual plan, rather than relying on someone independently knowing `MANUAL_TEST_PLAN.md` exists.
- The pending "untrack `local.properties`" action (previously a Code & Repo Hygiene bullet) isn't duplicated here — it's tracked in Pass 24 above and in the active to-do list for the upcoming Clear Git State pass.

---

### Pass 28 — `fix/save-navigation` branch

#### Bug Fixes ✅
- **Post-save navigation:** Saving a new task now navigates to TaskDetailScreen via `pendingTaskId` StateFlow; saving a new reward navigates to RewardDetailScreen via `pendingRewardId` StateFlow. Saving an existing task or reward still shows a snackbar and stays on screen. Previously all four cases stayed on screen (Pass 16 behaviour — correct for edits, wrong for creates).
- **Brief duplicate-name flash after SAVE:** `nameConflict` in both `TaskEditScreen` and `RewardEditScreen` is now gated on `!pendingSaveNav` / `!pendingRewardSaveNav`, so the red error doesn't flash on screen as navigation is composing out.
- **`pendingTaskId` leaking to unrelated `RewardEditScreen`:** When a standalone task was created and the user navigated to a reward form before the `LaunchedEffect` in `TaskEditScreen` consumed `pendingTaskId`, the reward form auto-included the leaked task. Fixed with an `awaitingNewTask` flag — auto-include only fires when the current reward form initiated the task creation via "Create your own."
- **`awaitingNewTask` lost on back-navigation:** `awaitingNewTask` was `remember { mutableStateOf(false) }`, which resets when the composable is destroyed. Compose NavHost destroys the outgoing composable on every forward navigation, so the flag was gone by the time the user popped back from `TaskEditScreen`. Changed to `rememberSaveable` — value is saved to the `NavBackStackEntry` saved state and restored on recreation.
- **Add task dialog checkbox not toggling on text tap:** `TaskRow` in `AddTaskToRewardDialog` had no click handler on the surrounding `Row` — only the `Checkbox` itself was interactive. Tapping the task name text did nothing. Row is now `.clickable { toggle }` with `onCheckedChange = null` on the `Checkbox` (M3 pattern: Row owns the toggle). Pre-existing tests in `SettingsUiTest` and `UiHappyPathTest` that called `.performClick()` on the task name were passing accidentally — auto-include was placing the task behind the dialog filter, so the click landed on the background row, not the dialog.

#### UX Improvement ✅
- **"Add task" disabled until reward name entered:** `AddTaskToRewardDialog` and "Create your own" are now gated on `name.isNotBlank()` — a reward form without a name can't link tasks yet.
- **"Will be added to: [reward name]" context line:** `TaskEditScreen` receives the in-progress reward name as a `fromRewardName` nav arg and shows it below the task name field when opened from a new-reward form, so the user knows which reward the task will be attached to.

#### Complexity & Pattern Health ✅
- `awaitingNewTask by rememberSaveable` is now consistent with the other `RewardEditScreen` form fields (`name`, `cost`, `description`, `icon`) which are already `rememberSaveable`.
- `TaskRow` using `onCheckedChange = null` + parent `.clickable` is the recommended M3 pattern for checkbox list rows — matches how `LogTaskDialog` rows were fixed in Pass 4.

#### Tests ✅
- Added `PendingRewardIdTest` (3 unit tests): `saveReward` sets `pendingRewardId` on new reward; leaves it null on edit; `consumePendingRewardId` clears the value.
- Added `SaveNavigationUiTest` (4 UI tests): new task navigates to TaskDetailScreen; new reward navigates to RewardDetailScreen; task created from new-reward form pops back and auto-includes; "Add task" disabled until reward name entered.
- `TESTING.md` counts updated (unit 82→85, UI 8→9, instrumented 26→30).

#### Linting ✅
- `ktlintFormat` run; one violation auto-fixed (`multiline-expression-wrapping` on the new `Modifier` chain in `TaskRow`).

#### Spec ✅
- Screen map entries for Reward Edit and Task Edit updated to reflect post-save navigation behaviour, the `fromRewardName` context line, and the "Add task" gate.
- `TESTING.md` "True process death" note updated: `awaitingNewTask` now also protected by `rememberSaveable`.

---

### Pass 29 — `chore/pre-release-cleanup` branch (pre-release code review)

#### Dynamic version string ✅
- `Strings.APP_VERSION = "Version: 1.0"` removed — would have drifted silently when `versionName` was incremented.
- `buildConfig = true` added to `buildFeatures` in `app/build.gradle.kts`; both `AboutScreen` and `SettingsScreen` now read `"Version: ${BuildConfig.VERSION_NAME}"` at runtime — always matches the build.

#### Inline strings → Strings.kt ✅
- Added `DIALOG_LOG_BTN = "LOG"` and `DIALOG_CANCEL = "CANCEL"` — `LogTaskDialog` and `AddTaskToRewardDialog` dismiss/confirm buttons were raw string literals.
- Added `fun claimDialogTitle(name: String)` — `ClaimDialog` title was an inline string template.
- Added `fun rewardEarnTasksTitle(count: Int)` — "Complete to earn points (N)" section header in `RewardDetailScreen` was inline.
- Added `REWARD_ROAD_TO_GLORY` and `REWARD_RECENT_ACTIVITY` — activity section header toggle in `RewardDetailScreen` was inline.
- `AboutScreen` Back arrow `contentDescription = "Back"` → `Strings.BACK_DESC` (constant already existed).

#### Known Limitations documented ✅
- Progress bar track backgrounds, disabled LOG button fill/border, detail dividers, and activity-log task name color are hardcoded warm-gold hex values that do not adapt to Ocean Blue or Forest themes. Added to `DEV_PLAYBOOK.md §4 Known Limitations`.

#### Test data ✅
- `TestDataSeeder.seed()`: Spa Day reward had a log attributed to `cook` (Cook Healthy Meal) which was never linked to Spa Day via a cross-ref — an orphaned log that inflated the reward balance with a task the user couldn't have seen in the log dialog. Replaced with a `walk` (Evening Walk) log, which is a valid linked task with `isRepeatable = true`.

#### Test suite refactor and coverage (QA pass) ✅
- Extracted `RepositoryTestBase` (unit): 7 files shared identical MockK setup — now inherit from one base class.
- Extracted `ViewModelTestBase` (unit): 4 files shared identical dispatcher setup/teardown — now inherit from one base class.
- Extracted `RoomIntegrationBase` (instrumented): 4 files shared identical in-memory Room setup/teardown — now inherit from one base class.
- `SaveNavigationUiTest.saveNewReward_navigatesToRewardDetail`: raw `"No tasks added yet."` → `Strings.REWARD_DETAIL_NO_TASKS` so the assertion stays in sync with the constant.
- `PointFormulaTest`: added `difficulty=5` and `preparation=5` bonus cases — previously only `time=5` was covered, leaving two bonus-trigger paths untested.
- `RewardLimitUiTest` (new, instrumented UI): verifies that tapping the FAB when `maxRewardCount` is reached shows `MAX_REWARD_BANNER` tooltip and does not navigate to reward edit.
- `DuplicateNameUiTest` (new, instrumented UI): verifies that entering a duplicate task or reward name (case-insensitive) shows the error string from `Strings.taskDuplicateError` / `Strings.rewardDuplicateError` and disables the SAVE button.

---

### Pass 30 — `fix/data-safety-and-cleanup` branch (senior-Android review follow-up)

#### Data safety ✅
- `EarnItRepository`'s multi-step mutations (`importFromJson`, `deleteReward`, `clearAllTasks`/`clearAllRewards`/`clearAllLogs`, `importTemplate`, `copyRewardFromEntry`) were sequences of independent DAO calls with no transaction — a crash or process death mid-sequence (e.g. mid-"Replace all data" import) could leave the DB half-mutated with the original data already gone. Wrapped each in `database.withTransaction { }`.
- `AppModule`'s `fallbackToDestructiveMigration(dropAllTables = true)` had only one real migration (`MIGRATION_9_10`) behind it — any future version bump without a matching migration would silently wipe every user's tasks, rewards, and permanent History. Documented the risk and the required discipline in `DEV_PLAYBOOK.md §6` (new section), with inline warnings at both load-bearing call sites (`EarnItDatabase.kt`, `AppModule.kt`).

#### Schema baseline reset ✅
- Confirmed (user-verified) this app has never been installed outside dev/emulator environments — no real device has schema v1–v10 data to preserve. Collapsed the dev-only migration history: `EarnItDatabase` version reset from 10 to 1 as the launch baseline; `MIGRATION_9_10` deleted (confirmed unreferenced by any test). `EARNIT_SPEC.md`'s schema version note updated to match.
- Added declarative `@ForeignKey` (cascade delete) + a matching index to `RewardTaskCrossRef` for both `rewardId` and `taskId` — baked directly into the v1 baseline rather than a migration, since there's no prior schema to migrate from. Scoped narrowly to this table only: `CompletionLogEntity.taskId` and `HistoryEntryEntity.rewardId` are deliberate historical snapshots (survive their source task/reward being deleted) and must not cascade.

#### Coroutine scope consistency ✅
- `WidgetTaskLogActivity` hand-rolled `CoroutineScope(SupervisorJob() + Dispatchers.X)` at two call sites to outlive its own `finish()` — correct behaviour, but not swappable in tests and with no shared error handling. Replaced with a single injected `@ApplicationScope`-qualified `CoroutineScope` singleton (`AppModule`).

#### Dead code ✅
- `WidgetTaskLogActivity`: removed two `Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.O` guards — minSdk is 31, already exceeding O (26), so the branches were always true. Also removed the only deprecated-API call in the file (`vibrator.vibrate(Int)`) along with its `@Suppress("DEPRECATION")`, since it lived in the now-dead branch.

#### Tooling ✅
- Migrated every hardcoded dependency/plugin version across both `build.gradle.kts` files into `gradle/libs.versions.toml`. The `buildscript classpath` Kotlin override stays a literal (catalog accessors aren't available in that block) but is commented to flag the sync requirement. Noted the catalog as source of truth in `DEV_PLAYBOOK.md §5`.

#### Test infrastructure fix ✅
- The `withTransaction` wrapping above hung every test touching a wrapped method indefinitely: Room's real transaction executor never runs on a bare MockK mock, so `runBlocking` waited forever instead of failing fast. Root-caused via a `jstack` thread dump (not assumption) after an earlier misdiagnosis. Fixed centrally in `RepositoryTestBase` with a `mockkStatic`-based stub that runs the block directly — covers `CleanupTest`, `DeleteCascadeTest`, `ImportDedupTest`, and `RepositoryBehaviourTest` in one place.

#### Tests ✅ (deferred item logged)
- All 102 unit tests pass; `ktlintCheck` and `assembleDebug` both green on the final branch state.
- Real transaction rollback (as opposed to DAO call sequencing) isn't covered — MockK can't simulate it. Logged as a new gap in `TESTING.md` Deferrals rather than silently left uncovered.

#### Follow-up: transaction-wrapping completeness ✅ (second-round senior-Android review)
- The original data-safety pass above scoped `database.withTransaction { }` to a specific method list rather than sweeping the whole file — `claimReward` (the core "earn a reward" flow: insert History entry → archive logs → conditionally archive the reward), `deleteTask`, `saveRewardTasks`, and `updateTaskRewards` had the identical multi-DAO-call risk profile but were missed. `DeleteCascadeTest` had `deleteTask` and `deleteReward` tests sitting side by side — only `deleteReward` had been fixed. Wrapped all four; `TESTING.md`'s Transaction rollback deferral list updated to match.
- The `@ForeignKey` cascade added above (Schema baseline reset) made the manual `rewardTaskDao.clearTasksForReward`/`clearRewardsForTask` calls in `deleteReward`/`deleteTask` redundant — SQLite now removes the cross-ref rows declaratively. Removed both call sites, deleted the now-unused `clearRewardsForTask` DAO method, and dropped `deleteTask`'s transaction wrapper since it's now a single statement. `DeleteCascadeTest` updated to assert the manual clear no longer happens instead of asserting call order; new `TESTING.md` Deferrals entry notes cascade behaviour itself isn't verified against a real DB.
- All unit tests and `ktlintCheck` re-verified green after each change.

---

### Pass 31 — `feat/onboarding-nudges` branch (first-run guidance)

#### Design System ✅
- Extracted `DismissibleTipBanner` into `EarnItButtons.kt` before writing either of the two new nudges — the codebase had no existing "shown once, dismissible, persisted" banner pattern (`MAX_REWARD_BANNER` is transient/auto-hide, the mascot settings badge is session-only), so this is a new shared primitive with two call sites from the start rather than a later extraction.

#### Empty-state copy ✅
- `HOME_EMPTY_REWARDS`, `REWARD_DETAIL_NO_TASKS`, `TASK_DETAIL_NO_REWARDS` expanded to explain *why* (tasks earn points toward rewards), not just *what to tap next*. Left `TASKS_EMPTY_*`, `HISTORY_NO_*`, `WIDGET_CONFIG_EMPTY`, and `NO_ACTIVITY` unchanged — those are either direct action lists where the concept was already taught upstream, or purely retrospective views with nothing to teach.

#### New feature: onboarding nudges ✅
- Widget nudge (Reward Detail): dismissible banner shown the first time a reward has a task linked, unless the user already has any EarnIt widget pinned. Action calls `AppWidgetManager.requestPinAppWidget()` (new — no prior use of the pin-request API in this codebase) rather than just instructing the user to long-press the home screen. Deliberately does **not** pre-select the reward in `WidgetConfigActivity` — doing so would require threading a reward ID through `EXTRA_APPWIDGET_PROVIDER_EXTRAS`, untested plumbing with no existing precedent; scoped down after discussing the risk/benefit with the user.
- Settings tip: single dismissible banner at the top of Settings, shown once on first visit, rather than three separate nudges for name/quote/theme individually (rejected as likely to feel naggy for cosmetic, non-core-loop settings).
- Both persist their dismissed state one-way via new `SettingsRepository`/`AppSettings` boolean flags (`widgetNudgeDismissed`, `settingsTipDismissed`), following the exact existing DataStore convention — no new abstraction introduced.

#### Spec Review ✅
- `EARNIT_SPEC.md` §3 (Widget Nudge) and §6 (Discoverability Tip) added; §9 test count bumped.

#### Tests ✅
- Added `WidgetNudgeUiTest` and `SettingsTipUiTest` — each verifies show/hide conditions, dismiss behaviour, and that the dismissal survives `activityRule.scenario.recreate()` (proving the DataStore flag round-trips, not just in-memory state). `TESTING.md` updated with both rows and bumped counts.
- `./gradlew ktlintCheck`, `test`, `assembleDebug`, and `assembleDebugAndroidTest` all pass. `connectedDebugAndroidTest` run on a real device by the user afterward — all instrumented tests pass, including the two new ones.
- Added a step to `MANUAL_TEST_PLAN.md`'s "Widget full flow" journey covering the new pin-request entry point, since the launcher's system "add to home screen" dialog is exactly the kind of system-process boundary already established as manual-only for the rest of the widget flow.

### Pass 32 — `fix/add-task-shortcut` branch

#### Bug fix ✅
- Home card's "+ ADD TASKS" pill (rewards with no tasks linked) navigated to Reward Edit instead of opening the Add Task dialog, forcing a second tap once there. The widget's ADD TASK button had the same gap: it opened the app to Reward Detail but never triggered the dialog.
- Added an `autoOpenAddTask` nav argument on `Screen.RewardDetail`, threaded through `MainActivity` (new intent extra) → `EarnItApp` → the `RewardDetail` composable → `RewardDetailScreen`, which now seeds `showAddTaskDialog` from it. Both entry points reuse `RewardDetailScreen`'s existing dialog + immediate-persist logic (`viewModel.addTaskToReward`) rather than duplicating it on `HomeScreen`.

#### Complexity & Pattern Health ✅
- Caught during review, not before: keying the nav-trigger `LaunchedEffect` on the raw `(startRewardId, autoOpenAddTask)` values meant a second, identical intent — e.g. tapping the widget's ADD TASK button twice for the same reward while the app is already showing it — wouldn't re-fire the effect, so the dialog would silently fail to reopen. The pre-existing `rewardId`-only version had the same staleness quirk but it was harmless there (re-navigating to a screen you're already on is a no-op); for add-task it wasn't. Fixed with a `navRequestToken` counter in `MainActivity`, bumped on every `onCreate`/`onNewIntent` and threaded through as the effect's key, so it fires on every new intent regardless of whether the payload repeats.

#### Naming Consistency ✅
- `HomeScreen`'s `RewardProgressCard` parameter `onEditReward` renamed to `onAddTask` — it only ever wired the add-tasks pill (single call site) and never opened Reward Edit, so the old name was actively misleading.

#### Spec Review ✅
- `EARNIT_SPEC.md` widget Display States and §10 Screen Map updated to describe the dialog auto-opening from both entry points.

#### Tests ✅
- Initially added a standalone `AddTaskShortcutUiTest` with one test — caught on checklist review that this violates the stated "3+ tests to justify a new file" threshold, so folded it into `SaveNavigationUiTest` instead (same theme: post-action navigation around the reward/task forms, same fixture setup) and deleted the standalone file. `TESTING.md`'s `SaveNavigationUiTest` row bumped from (4) to (5) with an exact count; no other counts touched since they're intentionally rounded approximations, not a maintained tally.
- `MANUAL_TEST_PLAN.md` widget step 7 updated to assert the dialog opens directly instead of just landing on the reward detail screen.
- `./gradlew ktlintCheck`, `test`, `assembleDebug`, and `assembleDebugAndroidTest` all pass. `connectedDebugAndroidTest` still needs to run on a real device to confirm the new test and the widget tap path end-to-end.

### Pass 32 continued — widget refresh bug + widget test coverage (same branch)

User manually tested the flow above and found a second bug, which led to a second checklist pass on the additional diff (widget refresh fix, new `WidgetActionButton.kt`/`WidgetTestTags.kt`, new test files, new Gradle dependencies).

#### Bug fix ✅
- Repro: tap ADD TASK on the widget → add a task via the dialog → return to the home screen → the widget shows **no** action button at all (not ADD TASK, not LOG). Root cause: `EarnItViewModel.addTaskToReward()` was the only reward/task-mutating ViewModel function that didn't call `refreshWidgets()` afterward (unlike `logTask()` and `claimReward()`), and the widget has no periodic refresh (`updatePeriodMillis="0"`) or Room-invalidation hook of its own — it kept rendering the stale pre-add `RemoteViews`. Fixed by adding the same `refreshWidgets()` call the other two functions already make.
- This was reachable before this branch too (e.g. adding a task from Reward Detail's pre-existing "Add task" button while a widget was pinned), but this branch made it obviously reachable — the widget itself now funnels users into `addTaskToReward`.

#### Duplication ✅
- Found on checklist review: the testTag strings (`"widget_claim_button"` etc.) added to `EarnItWidget.kt` for the new tests below were hand-typed a second time in the test file to match. A typo in either copy wouldn't necessarily fail loudly — `assertDoesNotExist()` on a mistyped tag would falsely pass, masking a real bug instead of catching one. Extracted both copies into a shared `internal object WidgetTestTags` (new file) referenced from both `EarnItWidget.kt` and `WidgetContentTest.kt`.

#### Complexity & Pattern Health ✅
- The widget's button-selection logic (`CLAIM`/`LOG`/`ADD_TASK`, previously a boolean `when` with no `else` that silently rendered nothing on fall-through — the actual shape of the bug above) extracted into `widgetActionButtonFor(progress): WidgetActionButton` (new file `WidgetActionButton.kt`), called from `StandardContent` via an exhaustive `when` over the new enum. A missing branch is now a compile error instead of a silent empty render.

#### Tests ✅
- `WidgetFlashTest` was the only prior widget test, and it only covers the SharedPreferences flash timer — nothing asserted on the widget's actual rendered buttons/text, which is exactly the layer that broke. Added two new files:
  - `WidgetActionButtonTest` (6 tests, plain JVM) — the extracted button-selection function directly, no Glance/Robolectric needed.
  - `WidgetContentTest` (12 tests) — renders `StandardContent`/`FlashContent`/`EmptyState`/`ClaimedState` via `androidx.glance:glance-testing` + `glance-appwidget-testing` (new `testImplementation` deps, `glance`/`glance-appwidget` bumped 1.1.0 → 1.1.1 to match) and `org.robolectric:robolectric` (new dep; first use of Robolectric in this project, plus `testOptions.unitTests.isIncludeAndroidResources = true`). Both are JVM-only (`app/src/test`), no device needed. `StandardContent`/`FlashContent`/`EmptyState`/`ClaimedState`/`WidgetColors` changed from `private` to `internal` so the test source set can render them directly, bypassing `provideGlance`'s Hilt/Room pipeline in favor of fixture-driven `RewardProgress` values (same pattern as `GatekeeperTest`/`RewardProgressTest`).
  - Known limitation, documented in `WidgetContentTest`'s file comment and `TESTING.md`: `glance-testing`'s `hasStartActivityClickAction()` matcher doesn't recognize the raw-`Intent` `actionStartActivity` overload this widget uses (it builds a `StartActivityIntentAction`, which the matcher's source doesn't check for) — so these tests confirm a button exists and has *some* click action, not that it targets the correct `Intent` extras. Still manual, per `MANUAL_TEST_PLAN.md`.
- Gap found and deliberately **not** fixed this pass: there is still no regression test for the actual bug fixed above (`addTaskToReward` calling `refreshWidgets()`). `refreshWidgets()` calls `EarnItGlanceWidget().updateAll(context)` by direct instantiation, not through an injected/mockable seam, so it can't be verified with MockK the way other ViewModel behaviour is — and this is a pre-existing gap shared by `logTask()`/`claimReward()`'s identical calls, not something newly introduced. Making it testable would mean injecting a widget-refresh interface via Hilt, which is a real architectural change out of scope for this fix. Deferred; noted in `TESTING.md` Deferrals.
- `TESTING.md`: Tier 4 description updated (widget content no longer "deferred", widget activity-chain/live-data wiring still is), two new exact-count rows added, new Edge Cases entry, new Deferrals entry for the `refreshWidgets()` coverage gap above.
- `MANUAL_TEST_PLAN.md` "Widget full flow": steps that only re-confirmed content now covered by the two new test files were shortened to point at the specific test and focus on what's still uniquely manual (live Room/DataStore wiring through `provideGlance`, the ADD TASK cross-activity intent → navigation → dialog chain, real widget-host rendering). No step deleted outright — each still exercises the real pipeline, which the new unit tests deliberately bypass.
- `./gradlew ktlintCheck`, `test`, `assembleDebug`, and `assembleDebugAndroidTest` all pass; the 18 new tests individually confirmed via the JUnit XML report (not just a green `test` task).

---

### Pass 33 — `feature/inactivity-nudges` branch (48h/96h idle notifications)

#### Duplication ✅
- The three dev-tool buttons in the new "Inactivity nudge" card repeat the same `OutlinedButton`/`shape`/`weight` styling inline — reviewed against the existing "Load test data"/"Load full test data" cards in the same file, which follow the identical unextracted-per-card convention. Left as-is; consistent with local precedent, not new debt.
- No duplicated strings, no `Repository`/`ViewModel` logic duplicated, no `Dao` query overlapping an existing one.

#### Decoupling ✅
- `NudgeDebugCard`'s "CHECK NOW" button calls `NudgeScheduler.runNow(context)` directly from the composable rather than routing through the `ViewModel`. Reviewed against precedent: `EarnItGlanceWidget().updateAll(context)` is already called directly from UI/Activity code elsewhere in this codebase (not exclusively through the ViewModel) for the same reason — it's a system-scheduling call, not app state/business logic. Left as-is.
- No business logic in composables, no ViewModel referencing UI types, no data layer referencing UI/ViewModel concerns.

#### Complexity & Pattern Health ✅ (1 fix)
- **Fixed:** the new "Inactivity nudge" dev card (52 lines) was inline inside `DataScreen`, an already-large single composable. Extracted into a new private `NudgeDebugCard(viewModel, context)` composable so this branch's addition doesn't grow the existing giant-composable debt further. (`DataScreen` itself was already ~305 lines pre-branch — a pre-existing condition, out of scope for this pass.)
- `NudgeDecider`/`NudgeWorker`/`NudgeScheduler` are each single-purpose, single-caller — reviewed as earning their keep: they centralize the WorkManager unique-work-name strings and threshold constants that would otherwise be duplicated across files.

#### Dead Code & Hygiene ✅
- No unused imports/vars (ktlint's unused-import rule ran clean on every check).
- Dev-only debug method (`debugBackdateLastLog`) added directly under the existing `// TEST DATA — gated behind Settings.devModeEnabled` comment block in `EarnItRepository.kt`, consistent with `seedTestData`/`seedFullTestData`.
- Debug-card strings ("Inactivity nudge", "-49H", "CHECK NOW", etc.) left inline rather than moved to `Strings.kt` — reviewed against the existing "Load test data"/"Load full test data"/"Developer mode active" cards in the same file, none of which are in `Strings.kt` either. Production-facing nudge notification copy *is* in `Strings.kt` (`NUDGE_FIRST_TITLE` etc.); the local convention is dev-only debug strings stay inline, user-facing strings go to `Strings.kt`.
- `git status` clean, no stray untracked files.

#### Naming Consistency ✅
- New `com.earnit.app.nudge` package follows the existing flat-by-feature convention (`data/`, `ui/`, `viewmodel/`, `widget/`).
- `NudgeDecider`/`NudgeWorker`/`NudgeScheduler`/`NudgeDecision` — no symbol conflicts with stdlib/Compose/AndroidX names.
- New `Strings.kt` constants follow the existing `WIDGET_*` naming style (`NUDGE_*`).

#### Hardcoded Values ✅ (2 fixes)
- **Fixed:** `NudgeScheduler`'s periodic check interval was a bare `6` in `PeriodicWorkRequestBuilder(6, TimeUnit.HOURS)` — extracted to `private const val CHECK_INTERVAL_HOURS = 6L`.
- **Fixed:** the dev-tool backdate amounts were bare `49`/`97`, disconnected from the 48h/96h thresholds they're meant to test — if the thresholds ever changed, the buttons could silently stop crossing the boundary. `NudgeDecider` now exposes `FIRST_THRESHOLD_HOURS = 48`/`SECOND_THRESHOLD_HOURS = 96` (with the existing `*_MS` constants derived from them), and `NudgeDebugCard` computes `threshold + 1h` from those instead of restating literals.
- No new hardcoded colors.

#### Accessibility ✅
- No new icon-only buttons (all three dev buttons have text labels). Touch targets unchanged from the existing `OutlinedButton` pattern used throughout this file.

#### Deprecated APIs ✅
- No deprecation warnings from the new WorkManager/Hilt-Work APIs or `MainActivity`'s new permission-request code.

#### Spec Review ✅
- `EARNIT_SPEC.md` §8a added, describing trigger conditions, global scope, two-nudge cap, notification content, `WorkManager` mechanism, and the dev tooling.
- Not a previously-listed Deferred Idea, so nothing to remove from that section.

#### Tests ✅
- `NudgeDeciderTest` (10 tests, new file) covers the pure decision logic: never-logged/no-active-reward guardrails, idle-under-threshold, both `Send` transitions, the stage-2 two-nudge cap, and reset-on-new-log from both stage 1 and stage 2.
- Reviewed for gaps: `EarnItRepository.debugBackdateLastLog` / `EarnItViewModel.debugBackdateLastLog` have no dedicated unit test. Checked against precedent — `seedTestData`/`seedFullTestData`/`TestDataSeeder` (the existing dev-only data helpers) have zero test coverage anywhere in the codebase either; this is an established, deliberate gap for dev-only tooling, not one newly introduced here. Left uncovered, consistent with precedent.
- `NudgeWorker`'s actual `doWork()` (notification post, permission check, settings write) is not unit- or instrumented-tested — same category as `WidgetTaskLogActivity`'s notification code: real background execution + system notification outside what a JVM or Compose UI test can drive. Added to `MANUAL_TEST_PLAN.md` instead (new "Inactivity nudge notifications" journey), with the dev-tool card built specifically to make that journey checkable in a couple of minutes instead of requiring real 48h/96h waits.
- This change adds a new `@HiltWorker`/`@AssistedInject` site (`NudgeWorker`) and a new `@Inject` site (`EarnItApplication`'s `HiltWorkerFactory`). Confirmed `TestAppModule` doesn't need changes — it already provides `EarnItDatabase`/`SettingsRepository` as singletons, which is everything `NudgeWorker` depends on — and ran `./gradlew assembleDebugAndroidTest` to verify the full Hilt graph (including `TestAppModule`) still builds.
- `TESTING.md` updated: `NudgeDeciderTest` row added, unit test count `100+` → `110+` (rounded), manual-journey count `3` → `4`, Deferrals intro line mentions the `WorkManager` boundary alongside the existing system-boundary examples.
- `./gradlew ktlintCheck`, `test`, `assembleDebugAndroidTest`, `assembleDebug` all pass (run sequentially, not in parallel, per `CLAUDE.md`).

---

### Pass 33 continued — automated NudgeWorker coverage (same branch)

#### Tests ✅
- User pushback on the line above (`NudgeWorker.doWork()` "not unit- or instrumented-tested"): unlike `TestDataSeeder`, `NudgeWorker` is production code that runs for real users, so "manual only" was a weaker bar than the rest of this codebase holds itself to. Re-examined and found it *is* automatable — `androidx.work:work-testing`'s `TestListenableWorkerBuilder` lets a `CoroutineWorker` be constructed directly (bypassing Hilt/WorkManager scheduling) and its `doWork()` called from a plain JVM test, same Robolectric setup already used for `WidgetContentTest`.
- Added `androidx.work:work-testing` (`testImplementation`, same `work` version as `work-runtime-ktx`) and `NudgeWorkerTest` (8 tests, new file): both `Send` transitions post the correct real notification (title/body asserted via Robolectric's `NotificationManager` shadow, not just that *some* notification fired) and persist the correct `SettingsRepository.updateNudgeState` call; all `NoOp`/`Reset` cases post nothing; and the `POST_NOTIFICATIONS`-denied path specifically (state still recorded even though the notification can't be shown — verifies the permission gate doesn't also skip state persistence).
- This narrows, not eliminates, the manual "Inactivity nudge notifications" journey in `MANUAL_TEST_PLAN.md` — its rationale was rewritten to name only what's genuinely still unreachable by automation: real periodic `WorkManager` scheduling invoking the worker in a live process, real Hilt-generated-factory construction (the test constructs `NudgeWorker` directly), the real OS permission dialog, and an actual tap on the system notification tray.
- `TESTING.md`: `NudgeWorkerTest` row added, unit test count `110+` → `120+` (rounded).
- `./gradlew test --tests` confirms all 8 new tests individually pass (JUnit XML report checked, not just a green task); full `ktlintCheck`/`test`/`assembleDebugAndroidTest`/`assembleDebug` re-run clean after the change.

---

### Pass 33 continued — automated debugBackdateLastLog coverage (same branch)

#### Tests ✅
- Further pushback, and a sharper distinction than the "consistent with `seedTestData` precedent" reasoning above: `debugBackdateLastLog` isn't just dev tooling like `seedTestData` — it's the mechanism `MANUAL_TEST_PLAN.md`'s nudge journey *depends on* to validate `NudgeWorker`'s real wiring. If `seedTestData` were broken, a tester sees empty/wrong data immediately and knows something's off. If `debugBackdateLastLog`'s SQL were subtly wrong (wrong row picked, wrong timestamp math), the manual test would silently validate against corrupted state with no visible sign — undermining the one layer this feature still relies on manual testing for. That risk lives entirely in real SQL/Room behaviour, which `NudgeWorkerTest`'s mocked DAOs never exercise.
- Added `NudgeDataTest` (6 tests, new instrumented file, `RoomIntegrationBase`, real in-memory Room — matches this project's existing convention for exactly this class of risk, e.g. `HappyPathTest`/`ExportImportTest`): `getLastLogTimestamp` null with no logs and correctly picks the max among out-of-order inserts (not just the last-inserted row); `getActiveRewardCount` zero with no rewards and correctly excludes archived ones; `debugBackdateLastLog` updates only the most-recent log (a second, older log in the same table is asserted untouched) and is a safe no-op with no logs at all.
- Run for real on a connected device (`./gradlew connectedDebugAndroidTest`, class-filtered to `NudgeDataTest`), not just compiled — 6/6 pass, confirmed via the instrumented JUnit XML report, per `DEV_PLAYBOOK.md`'s "confirm instrumented tests actually run on a device" step.
- `TESTING.md`: `NudgeDataTest` row added under the Repository layer, instrumented test count `~45` → `~50` (rounded, ballpark only — file counts left as-is per this doc's own "rounded, not a maintained tally" guidance).
- Full `ktlintCheck`/`test`/`assembleDebugAndroidTest`/`assembleDebug` re-run clean after the change.

---

### Pass 34 — live-device bug fix + CI regression (same branch)

#### Duplication ✅ (1 fix)
- Fixing the backdate SQL (below) required "hours → ms" math in two new places (`EarnItRepository.debugBackdateLastLog`, `EarnItViewModel.debugGetLastLogIdleHours`), on top of the same `60 * 60 * 1000` literal already appearing twice in `NudgeDecider`'s threshold constants — four copies across the codebase. First attempt centralized it into a `NudgeDecider.MS_PER_HOUR` constant referenced from `EarnItRepository` — see Decoupling below for why that was wrong. Fixed with `java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit` at both new call sites instead: no custom constant, no cross-package dependency. `NudgeDecider`'s own two threshold constants still derive from a local `MS_PER_HOUR`, kept self-contained (not exported).

#### Decoupling ✅ (1 caught before it shipped)
- The first version of the fix above had `EarnItRepository` (`data/`) importing `NudgeDecider` (`nudge/`). `grep`-checked for existing `data/` → `nudge/` imports first (none existed) — this codebase's layering runs the other direction (`NudgeWorker` already imports `EarnItDatabase`/`SettingsRepository`; `data/` has no business knowing `nudge/` exists). Reverted to `TimeUnit` before it landed.

#### Tests ✅ (4 new tests, 1 coverage gap closed, 1 test rewritten to actually reproduce the bug it was meant to catch)
- **The reported bug:** dev-tool taps appeared to do nothing. Diagnosed live against a connected device — pulled the on-device Room DB via `adb ... run-as`, found 5 completion logs within the last 48h; `logcat` confirmed `NudgeWorker` ran successfully both times with no crash. Root cause: `debugBackdateLastLog`'s SQL only rewrote the single most-recent log's timestamp. With "Load full test data" seeding many logs, several sit within seconds of each other — backdating one just promoted the next-newest to the new global max, so the worker correctly saw recent activity and correctly no-opped. Not a worker bug; a dev-tool data bug.
- **Why the existing test didn't catch it:** `NudgeDataTest`'s original case used two logs with ancient, arbitrary timestamps (1000ms/5000ms) and asserted the SQL did what it was designed to do (touch one row) — it never used a dataset shaped like the real bug (several near-simultaneous *recent* logs), so it verified the implementation, not the requirement. Rewrote the case with multiple realistic recent logs; confirmed it fails against the old single-row SQL and passes against the fix (`UPDATE completion_logs SET timestamp = :cutoff WHERE timestamp > :cutoff`) — 6/6 pass, run for real on-device, not just compiled.
- **New coverage gap, closed:** the UX fix added `EarnItViewModel.debugGetLastLogIdleHours` (drives the status text now shown after every tap, specifically so a future silent failure like this one would be visible) with zero test coverage — same blind-spot category as the bug above. Added `NudgeDebugToolsTest` (3 tests, new file, root `com.earnit.app` test package alongside other ViewModel-level tests): whole-hour idle computation from a real timestamp, null when nothing's ever logged, and `debugBackdateLastLog`'s completion callback fires exactly once after the repository write completes — the ordering the simplified 48H/96H buttons depend on to avoid racing `NudgeWorker` against an in-flight DB write.
- **Separate CI regression:** `instrumented-tests` failed on the already-pushed PR (`IllegalStateException: No compose hierarchies found`, ~7 unrelated pre-existing UI tests). Initially misread as the already-documented Android-16-device issue in this doc's Deferrals — ruled out by checking `main`'s CI history (green as of the prior day) and confirming none of the new `Nudge*` tests were among the failures. Actual cause: `MainActivity`'s `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` request (added earlier in this branch) pops a real system dialog on every launch on API 33+, and CI's emulator is API 34 — nearly every UI test launches `MainActivity`. Fixed centrally in `HiltTestRunner.onCreate()` (grants the permission once via `UiAutomation`, before any test `Activity` launches — the same mechanism `GrantPermissionRule` uses internally) rather than adding that rule to ~10 individual test files. Verified against the same API level CI uses: full instrumented suite, 54/54 pass (was ~7 failing).

#### Hardcoded Values ✅ — the `MS_PER_HOUR` finding is covered under Duplication above; no other new magic numbers.

#### Spec Review ✅
- `EARNIT_SPEC.md`'s dev-tooling description and `MANUAL_TEST_PLAN.md`'s steps updated to match the simplified 2-button flow (was 3: two backdate buttons + a separate "CHECK NOW") and the History-timestamp side effect, which is surfaced directly in the debug card's UI, not just the docs — it's the kind of caveat someone could hit with real data present, not only test data.

#### Reviewed, no findings: Naming Consistency, Accessibility, Deprecated APIs, remaining Complexity & Pattern Health items, `git status` (one new untracked file, `NudgeDebugToolsTest.kt`, intentional).

- `./gradlew ktlintCheck`, `test` (141 tests total, all pass), `assembleDebugAndroidTest`, `assembleDebug`, and `connectedDebugAndroidTest` (full suite, 54/54, run on the same API level as CI) all green after every change in this pass — not just the final state.

### Pass 35 — `feature/dev-unlock` branch (secret mascot gesture)

#### Duplication ✅
- No composables copy-pasted, no styling patterns repeated inline, no ViewModel/Repository/Dao overlap.
- The new "Sorry, no dev mode at this time" snackbar string is inline in `AboutScreen.kt` rather than in `Strings.kt` — reviewed against what it replaced: the prior "Developer options enabled" string occupied the exact same spot and was also inline, never in `Strings.kt`. Consistent with local precedent at this call site, not new debt.

#### Decoupling ✅ (addressed by design, not found after the fact)
- The tap-timing state machine (group-gap boundary, pause window, reset-on-violation) is exactly the kind of business logic the Decoupling checklist warns against leaving in a composable. Extracted up front into `PugslyGesture`, a plain Kotlin object with no Compose/Android imports — `HomeScreen`'s click handler only calls `nextState`/`isComplete`.
- No ViewModel referencing UI types, no data layer referencing ViewModel/UI concerns.

#### Complexity & Pattern Health ✅ (1 fix)
- **Fixed:** the click handler wrapped `viewModel.enableDevMode()` and `viewModel.bounceMascot()` in a `homeScope.launch { }` coroutine block, but neither call is `suspend` — `enableDevMode()` already launches its own `viewModelScope` coroutine internally, and `bounceMascot()` just calls `tryEmit` synchronously. The wrapping launch was dead ceremony (coroutine scope used where none was needed). Removed; both calls now happen directly in the click lambda.
- `PugslyGesture` has a single caller (`HomeScreen`) — checked against the "does this extraction earn its keep" question: yes, per the Decoupling item above, this is exactly the pure-logic-out-of-composable pattern the checklist asks for, and it's what made the boundary-condition unit tests possible at all.
- Modifier chain on the mascot `Image` (`size → scale → clickable` with a ~10-line lambda) reviewed against `AboutScreen`'s existing version-text `clickable` — same shape and length, consistent with local convention.
- No new/changed `LaunchedEffect` keys. `pugslyTapTimestamps` uses plain `remember`, not `rememberSaveable` — correct: an in-progress secret tap sequence should *not* survive a config change, and it holds no user data.

#### Dead Code & Hygiene ✅
- No unused imports/vars — ktlint's unused-import rule ran clean on every check.
- No commented-out code, no orphaned resources, no stale TODOs.
- `git status` clean apart from the intended new files (`PugslyGesture.kt`, `PugslyGestureTest.kt`).

#### Naming Consistency ✅
- `PugslyGesture.kt` follows the established "bare noun-phrase, pure-logic file" pattern (`WidgetActionButton.kt`, `NudgeDecider.kt`).
- Considered giving it `NudgeDecider`'s treatment — a dedicated top-level package — but `NudgeDecider` earns that because it's consumed by two independent callers (`NudgeWorker`, a debug UI card). `PugslyGesture` has one caller and is specifically a UI-input-gesture concern, closer to `WidgetActionButton.kt` living alongside `widget/`. Kept in `ui/` next to `HomeScreen.kt`.
- Timing constants (`GROUP_GAP_MS`, `PAUSE_MS`, `PATTERN_LENGTH`) live on `PugslyGesture` itself, not `Strings.kt` — they're not display strings, same pattern as `NudgeDecider`'s own threshold constants.

#### Hardcoded Values ✅
- No hardcoded colors. All timing values are named constants on `PugslyGesture`, not inline magic numbers.

#### Accessibility ✅ (1 deliberate trade-off, recorded not fixed)
- Tap target (`150.dp` mascot image) is well over the 48dp minimum.
- `contentDescription` on the mascot image stays `null` even though it's now interactive. This is intentional, not an oversight: giving it a label would announce "this is tappable" to anyone probing the screen (sighted or via TalkBack), which defeats the whole point of this pass — matches how the original About-screen 7-tap trigger was also never labeled as interactive.

#### Deprecated APIs ✅
- No deprecation warnings from any new API used.

#### Spec Review ✅
- Checked `EARNIT_SPEC.md` for any existing description of the dev-mode unlock mechanism — found none; it was never documented there. Nothing to update or contradict.
- Not a listed Deferred Idea.

#### Tests ✅ (10 new tests, 1 gap reviewed and left uncovered with rationale)
- `PugslyGestureTest` (10 tests, new file) covers the pure state machine: group-gap boundary (exact pass, one ms over resets), pause-window boundary (one ms short/over resets, exact min/max accepted), the full 7-tap success path, and two reset scenarios (extra tap before the pause, a slow tap mid-second-burst).
- Reviewed `EarnItViewModel.bounceMascot()` for coverage: it's a one-line wrapper around `_triggerMascotBounce.tryEmit(Unit)`. Checked precedent — `claimReward`'s existing `_triggerMascotBounce.tryEmit(Unit)` emission (this flow already existed before this branch) has never been unit tested anywhere in the codebase; it's a fire-and-forget animation trigger. Left uncovered, consistent with precedent, and testing a single delegating line would just restate the implementation.
- No new `@Inject` site or `AppModule`/`TestAppModule` change — `assembleDebugAndroidTest` not required by the letter of the rule, but re-ran it anyway since the ViewModel changed; graph still builds.
- `TESTING.md` updated: `PugslyGestureTest` row added, unit test count `120+` → `150+`. While updating that line, verified the real number rather than hand-tallying the table — summed the `tests="N"` attribute across every `app/build/test-results/testDebugUnitTest/*.xml` report from the full `./gradlew test` run: 151 total. The "120+" label predates this branch and was already stale by a wide margin; corrected to match the measured count (151, rounded to 150) instead of compounding the drift.
- `MANUAL_TEST_PLAN.md:58` — removed the specific unlock instruction ("7-tap the version number in About") per explicit direction, since it now describes the decoy, not the real mechanism, and documenting the actual gesture in a public repo file would defeat the feature's purpose. No replacement step added describing the new gesture, for the same reason.
- `./gradlew ktlintCheck`, `test` (10/10 new tests confirmed via JUnit XML, full suite green), `assembleDebug` all pass, run sequentially per `CLAUDE.md`.

### Pass 36 — `chore/cleanup-backlog-fixes` branch (whole-repo audit fixes)

Actioned findings #1, #2, #4–#8 from [CLEANUP_BACKLOG.md](CLEANUP_BACKLOG.md), a whole-repo audit against this checklist run 2026-07-10 against `main` at `59d9a82`. Finding #3 (five oversized composables) is deferred to its own branch, `refactor/split-oversized-screens` — comparable in scope to the Pass 10 `EarnItApp.kt` split, and the audit itself recommended not folding it into a hygiene pass. `CLEANUP_BACKLOG.md` stays in the repo, trimmed to that one remaining item, until that branch lands.

#### Duplication ✅ (2 fixes)
- **Fixed:** `TaskDetailScreen.kt` and `RewardDetailScreen.kt` each hand-rolled the LOG pill button (shadow/clip/gradient/border/click/padding) instead of reusing `LogPillButton` from `EarnItButtons.kt` — `HomeScreen.kt` already called it correctly. Both screens now call `LogPillButton` directly; a future LOG-button styling change is one edit instead of three. Visual side effect: both screens' LOG buttons now match `HomeScreen`'s (flat single-tone border/text, more compact padding) instead of each having a slightly different hand-rolled variant.
- **Fixed:** `TaskDetailScreen.kt` hardcoded `"Recent activity"` instead of the existing `Strings.REWARD_RECENT_ACTIVITY`, and hardcoded `"Used in rewards"` / `"Unknown reward"` with no `Strings.kt` entry at all. Added `TASK_DETAIL_USED_IN_REWARDS` and `TASK_DETAIL_UNKNOWN_REWARD`, routed all three through `Strings.kt`. Copy-only, no visible change.

#### Decoupling ✅
- No changes in this pass touched ViewModel/Repository/Dao boundaries.

#### Complexity & Pattern Health — 1 item deferred
- The five oversized composables finding (`RewardDetailScreen.kt` 694 lines, `TaskEditScreen.kt` ~637, `SettingsScreen.kt` ~430, `RewardEditScreen.kt` ~420, `HomeScreen.kt` ~320) is out of scope for this pass — tracked on `refactor/split-oversized-screens` instead.

#### Dead Code & Hygiene ✅
- Removed now-unused `border`/`Brush`/`compositeOver`/`sp` imports from `TaskDetailScreen.kt` and the unused `compositeOver` import from `RewardDetailScreen.kt`, left behind by the `LogPillButton` dedup.
- `git status` clean apart from intended changes.

#### Naming Consistency ✅ (1 fix)
- **Fixed:** `WidgetConfigActivity.kt:211` and `TaskLibraryScreen.kt:97` hardcoded `contentDescription = "Back"` instead of `Strings.BACK_DESC`, despite both files already using `Strings.*` elsewhere. Screen-reader-only string, no visible change.

#### Hardcoded Values ✅ (1 fix)
- **Fixed:** `EarnItPrimaryButton`'s `disabledContainerColor`/`disabledContentColor` were hardcoded to flat greys (`0xFFCCCCCC`/`0xFF999999`) that didn't adapt to Ocean Blue or Forest themes. Checked `DEV_PLAYBOOK.md §4 Known Limitations` first — the only documented hardcoded-disabled-color exception is `LogPillButton`'s warm-gold neutral colors, a different component; this one had no such exception on record. Removed both overrides — Material3's `ButtonDefaults.buttonColors()` already defaults to theme-aware `onSurface.copy(alpha = 0.12f/0.38f)`, so the fix was deletion, not reimplementation.

#### Accessibility ✅ (1 reviewed, documented as exception rather than fixed)
- `InfoIconButton` overrode Compose's default 48dp minimum touch target down to 24dp. Checked for prior rationale first — none found; Pass 1's introduction of `InfoIconButton` only mentions visual consistency, and this wasn't logged as an accepted exception anywhere, unlike `AddTaskToRewardDialog`'s 32dp case (Pass 5). Initially fixed by removing the override, but manual testing on `SettingsScreen`'s name/rewards/tasks toggles caught a visible side effect: Compose's `minimumInteractiveComponentSize()` reports the enlarged 48dp size to the parent layout (not just the touch system), so the row grew taller and pushed a noticeable gap above the info note it reveals. Reverted to 24dp and documented as a permanent, accepted exception in `DEV_PLAYBOOK.md §4 Known Limitations` instead.

#### Deprecated APIs ✅
- No deprecated API usage touched in this pass.

#### Spec Review ✅ (1 fix)
- **Fixed:** `devModeEnabled` was the only `AppSettings` field with no `EARNIT_SPEC.md §6` row — every other field, including more obscure ones, was documented. Added a row describing what it gates (test-data seeding, nudge debug buttons) without naming the unlock trigger. While in the area, fixed a stale comment in `EarnItRepository.kt` and `TestDataSeeder.kt` that still referenced the old "7-tap on About version" trigger, superseded by Pass 35's mascot-gesture unlock.

#### Tests ✅ (1 fix)
- **Fixed:** `TESTING.md`'s instrumented-test table was missing rows for `DuplicateNameUiTest` (2, added Pass 29) and `RewardLimitUiTest` (1, added Pass 29), and `PointFormulaTest`'s row said "(7)" against an actual 9 `@Test` methods (Pass 29 added `difficulty=5`/`preparation=5` bonus cases without bumping the row). Recounted directly via `@Test` grep per file rather than trusting the audit's stated numbers — corrected the audit's own "55 actual" claim to the true figure, 54 (the audit had double-counted a `@TestInstallIn` match in `TestAppModule.kt` as a real `@Test`).

#### Reviewed, no findings: Decoupling, Deprecated APIs — no changes in this pass touched either area.

### Pass 37 — CI instrumented-test flake fix + test-isolation hardening (on `refactor/split-task-edit-screen`, scoped to this fix only — not a full-branch pass)

Triggered by a CI-only failure (`autoPoints_slidersUpdateComputedTotal` in `TaskEditScreenUiTest`) on PR #26 that didn't reproduce from local code review. Root cause: `TestAppModule` scopes the in-memory Room database and `SettingsRepository`'s DataStore `@Singleton` on the process-wide Hilt component, so every `@HiltAndroidTest` UI test was leaking its data/settings into whichever test ran after it in the same instrumentation run — several tests (`EmptyStateUiTest`, `SettingsTipUiTest`, `RewardLimitUiTest`) were only passing by luck of execution order. This pass covers only that fix (14 files: the flaky test itself, a new shared reset helper, and its retrofit into every other affected test) — it does not re-review the rest of the branch's earlier TaskEditScreen-split commits.

#### Duplication ✅ (1 avoided)
- `resetAppState()` (new `TestStateReset.kt`) reuses the existing `EarnItRepository.clearAll()` (the repository's `database.clearAllTables()` wrapper, originally written for the app's "Start Over" flow) via a Hilt `@EntryPoint`, instead of re-implementing table clearing.

#### Decoupling ✅
- No changes touched ViewModel/Repository/Dao boundaries; `resetAppState()` lives entirely in the androidTest source set and only adds one new production method (`SettingsRepository.resetToDefaults()`, a thin DataStore wrapper matching the shape of every other `update*` method already on that class).

#### Complexity & Pattern Health ✅
- No composables touched. `resetAppState()` uses `runBlocking`, matching the pattern every retrofitted test's own `@Before` already used for settings setup (`SettingsUiTest`, `RewardLimitUiTest`, etc.).

#### Dead Code & Hygiene ✅
- `git status` clean apart from the intended 14 files (13 modified, 1 new).

#### Naming Consistency ✅
- `TestStateReset.kt` matches the existing androidTest helper naming style (`HiltTestRunner.kt`, `RoomIntegrationBase.kt`) rather than forcing a `*Screen.kt`/`*Test.kt` shape that doesn't fit a plain utility file.

#### Spec Review ✅
- `EARNIT_SPEC.md` only references the instrumented-test count in its testing summary, which this pass doesn't change (no tests added, only isolation fixed between existing ones). No update needed.

#### Tests ✅ (1 gap reviewed, none introduced)
- Reviewed whether `SettingsRepository.resetToDefaults()` needs unit coverage: `SettingsRepository` has no unit tests anywhere in the codebase today (DataStore needs a real `Context`; its existing coverage is entirely instrumented, via `SettingsUiTest`). Consistent with that precedent — left uncovered at the unit level; it's exercised implicitly by every instrumented test's `@Before` now.
- Could not run `connectedDebugAndroidTest` locally (no device/emulator attached this session); verified via `./gradlew assembleDebugAndroidTest` (Hilt graph resolves, all 12 retrofitted files compile against the new `@EntryPoint`) plus `ktlintCheck` and `test`. CI's API 34 emulator is the actual verification path for this change, consistent with the existing Android 16 local-verification gap logged in `TESTING.md` Deferrals.
- Updated `TESTING.md`: added a state-isolation convention note above the instrumented-tests table describing when `resetAppState()` is called and why `RoomIntegrationBase`-based tests don't need it.

#### Reviewed, no findings: remaining checklist items (Hardcoded Values, Accessibility, Deprecated APIs) don't apply — no UI surface in this pass.
